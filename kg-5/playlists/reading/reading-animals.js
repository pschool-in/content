Dogs love eating bones and they love to play. We can always play ‘fetch’ games with dogs. They move their tails rapidly whenever they want to play. The baby dogs are called puppies.`

They were of different sizes. Some were very small while some were very huge. Some of them even had wings to fly. Some also lived in the sea. 
We still have no idea what sounds dinosaurs used to make. But based on their body sizes, scientists have also assumed their voice. We can hear their voices in a lot of movies made on dinosaurs. For example, Jurassic Park series, Jurassic World, Godzilla, etc.       
Apart from being diverse in their body structures, the species were also different in their eating habits. Some were herbivores, some were carnivores and some were omnivores. It has been found that dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago. A meteor from space hit the earth. It led to the death of the species. `
