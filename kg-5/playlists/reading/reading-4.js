        text: `Ever since she was little, Aruna was curious about how things work. She loved breaking and fixing things to learn more about them. Radios, bicycles, clocks - whatever she could see, Aruna had to open it.
          Sometimes, she was able to put the things back together properly. Other times, they did not work when she was finished with them. Aruna's parents would be amused when they found her busy looking at gears, springs, and wires.
          They would bring her broken things from they find the neighborhood. She would work on them and fix them. The neighbors began to call her 'Miss Fix-it'. When Aruna got older, she went to an engineering college. Her lifelong love of exploring things helped in her studies. She graduated with excellent grades.
          Now, Aruna works as a toy designer. That makes her quite happy. Whenever she has an idea for a new toy, she creates a design and builds a model in her laboratory. Aruna likes having a job that is fun and makes children happy. 
          We should also learn from Aruna's curiosity.`

        text: `Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest Presidents of the United States of America (USA). He removed slavery from his country forever and kept it united.
          In those days, the blacks (dark-skinned people from Africa) were treated as slaves by the whites. The people in the North wanted to remove slavery. People in the South wanted to continue owning slaves.
          Slaves were bought and sold as property. They lived in very poor conditions. They had no personal or civil rights. The people in the South wanted to have their own country where they could still keep slaves.
          Lincoln argued that blacks had the right to life, freedom, and happiness. He did not allow the Southern states to form their own country. As a result, a war was declared between the northern and southern states.
          The war lasted for 4 years, and finally, the Northern states won. The country remained united. Slavery was made illegal in the USA. Lincoln issued a proclamation that freed all the slaves in the South.
          Lincoln was re-elected as the President. But only six days after the end of the war, Abraham Lincoln was shot dead. 
          Abraham Lincoln was a great leader. He was honest, hard-working, and a great visionary. He kept the country united. People still remember him and celebrate his life.`

        author: `Komal Ramchandani`,
        text: `Singapore, a small island nation, was ruled by other countries. It got separated from Malaysia and became independent in 1965. Singapore did not have many natural resources. So how did it become one of the world's most powerful countries?
          The success of Singapore is due to the efforts of Lee Kuan Yew. He is often called the founding father of Singapore. He became the country's first Prime Minister.
          He was in office from 1965 to 1990 i.e. for 25 years. 
          So what did he do that transformed Singapore into an advanced nation?
          Singapore is a port, a place where shipping activities take place. Lee used this as an advantage. The port was used for many trading activities. He made good policies which attracted foreign countries. He provided housing and employment to his people.
          Many people think that Lee's style of working was too controlling. He had strict control over the press. He did not allow much freedom of speech. He took all the decisions and did not allow any corrupt practices.
          In an interview, Lee Kuan Yew said, "You are entitled to call me whatever you like, but that doesn't make me one. Do I need to be a dictator when I can win? Hands down!"
          He made Singapore a country where there is a system and order. Lee Kuan Yew is rightly called the man who created Singapore. He is considered the architect of modern Singapore. He was a great world leader. He died at the age of 91 in 2015.`
