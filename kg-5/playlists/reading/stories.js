        text: `One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!
The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.
The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each one of them into the jug. As a result  of it, water level rose. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked! The crow drank the water happily and flew in the sky singing his favorite song.`,

        text: `Long ago, there lived a woodcutter in a small village. He was sincere in his work and very honest. Every day, he went into the nearby forest to cut trees. He brought the woods back into the village and sold them to a merchant and earned his money. He earned just enough to make a living, and he was satisfied with his simple living.
One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the river. The river was so deep, he could not take it out on his own. He had only one axe that fell into the river. He started to worry. He will not be able to earn his living now! He was very sad and prayed to the God. He prayed sincerely and God appeared in front of him and asked, “What is the problem, my son?” The woodcutter explained the problem and requested the God to get his axe back.
The God stretched his hand deep into the river and took out a silver axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The Woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. So, the God put his hand back deep into the water again and took a golden axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. The God said, “Take a look at it again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe. Are you sure, this is not yours?” The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine. I cannot cut trees with a golden axe. It’s not useful to me”.
The God smiled and finally put his hand into the water again and took out his iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes! This is mine! Thank you!” The God was very impressed with his honesty and she gave him his iron axe and also the other two axes as a reward for his honesty.`

So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, “What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”
The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and drink yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.
Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then, I shall help you also to come out.” The goat was innocent and did not realise the cunningness of the fox, and so did as the fox said and helped him to get out of the well.
While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have jumped in without thinking how to get out.`,

The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt him with his nose, and left the place. It is because, bears do not touch dead creatures. Now, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you in your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a fake friend.`,

The man wanted to get all the golden eggs from his hen at one single go. So, one day he thought hard and at last came up with a plan. He decided to kill the hen and get all the eggs together.
So, the next day when the hen laid a golden egg, the man caught hold of it, took a sharp knife, chopped off its neck and cut its body open. There was nothing but blood all around and there was no trace of any golden egg. He was very sad, because now he would not get even one single golden egg.
His life was going on smoothly with one golden egg a day, but now, he himself made his life miserable. Just because of his greediness, he became very poor.`,
