Birds like Canada Geese and Pelicans fly a long distance. The birds in the front flap their wings more times. So that other birds need not flap their wings more. They just glide through the air. Is it not amazing?`

Some flies use their feelers to measure the speed of the air when they are flying. Butterflies use their feelers to find out the direction to fly.`
