          "My favorite cartoon is Shin-chan. It is a story about a five-year-old boy who is very mischievous. He is always looking for adventure. He is very optimistic about life. He is very fond of Action Kamen, which is his favorite toon. He doesn't like to eat capsicum but his mother forces him to eat it. \n Shin chan's mother, Mitsi, is a perfect housewife. She takes care of all the family members. However, she is a little short-tempered. She hits Shin Chan on his head which forms a bulging on his head. She hides some money which she calls her 'secret savings'. She spends them on buying expensive clothes or cosmetics. Shin-chan, by some means, always, finds out where she has hidden her secret savings and then blackmails her that he would tell his dad. She, having no choice, buys him either Action Kamen set or Choco chips. \n Shin-chan lives in Japan. He goes to a kindergarten school. He has many friends. His main friends are Kazama and Masao. Shin-chan calls his principal 'Gang Leader' who has a very rough face, like a real gang leader.  But he is a good-natured and kind-hearted person. \n Shin-chan has a pet dog, Shiro. Shin-chan does not take good care of his dog. He never gives him his morning food. Though he is a naughty boy, everyone likes him very much."

          "Dora is my favorite cartoon character. She is a very determined girl and always keeps moving forward to reach her goal. Dora's adventures are usually about helping others who are in trouble. She has all the tools for her journey in her backpack. She knows how to read the map to reach her destination. 'Boots' is a monkey and it joins Dora in all her journeys. He usually wears nothing but his beloved red boots, hence his name. 'Swiper' is a fox. It wears a blue mask and gloves. It always tries to steal from Dora and others. But Dora doesn't punish the fox and simply shouts 'NO'. The fox respects her and runs away. Benny is another friend of Dora's. He is a big, strong bull with a huge appetite and an even bigger heart. He often tries to help Dora on her adventures, but Benny is so accident-prone that it is usually him in need of Dora's help."

Bheem always fought for justice and destroyed evil. Bheem was very popular in his town because he helped whoever was in need. Sometimes he even helped the king and received a lot of appreciation from the king and the people. Bheem’s best friends were Raju, Jaggu, and Chutki. Jaggu was a monkey and he was very active. Raju was a very naughty and cute boy. Chutki was a very cute and beautiful girl. Kalia was always jealous of Bheem, but Bheem liked him too.  Bheem was so good that he always helped Kalia whenever he fell in trouble, and even Kalia didn’t forget to help Bheem in return when needed. Dholu and Bholu were identical twins and they were often seen with Kalia. Bheem and his friends always worked as a team to succeed.'
