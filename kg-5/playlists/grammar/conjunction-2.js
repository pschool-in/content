        text: `The word that joins two or more words or sentences is called a conjunction. In simple words, conjunctions are joining words. The most common conjunctions are 'and', 'but', 'so' and 'or'.
For example:
'The bird can fly.' 'The bird can sing.'
These two sentences can be joined together with the help of conjunction. We can write it as;
'The bird can fly and sing.'
Some more examples are;
1. The monkey can walk and climb.
2. I am eating and watching TV.
3. Rahul tried to study but fell asleep.
4. I want to play but I need to study.
5. We can watch a movie or go for lunch.
6. I will complete my HW today or tomorrow.
7. My mother is late so I'm waiting for her.
8. We're going to the park in the evening, so I'll take a nap in the noon.`
