        text: `Plants are an important part of nature. Plants need good soil, water and sunlight. The main parts of the plant are root, stem, leaf, flower, vegetable and fruit. Plants gives us food, fresh air, medicine, wood etc.
# Leaf
It is usually green in colour. Leaves are of different shapes and sizes. Leaves have a life cycle on its own. A new leaf would be soft and small. It grows in size. And finally it will dry and fall to the ground. Leaves are food to animals like goat, cow and deer. We too eat some of the leaves. Though they are not tasty, they are healthy. 
# Flower
Many kids feel that flowers are the most attractive part of a plant. Flowers are of different shapes and colours. Some flowers smell nicely. We can see butterflies and bees sitting on flowers and drinking honey. 
# Vegetable & Fruit
In most of the plants, flowers become vegetables and fruits. They provide food to humans like us, and they are very healthy. 
# Seed
Seeds are very important to plant, because they help in bringing new plants. Farmers sow the seeds to grow plants. Birds eat the fruits and throw the seeds in some other places. And after few days, a new plant will come from the seeds.
# Stem
Stem is the strongest part of a plant. It helps the plant to stand straight. Plants with weak stems are usually creepers. They need support to grow.
# Root
Root is responsible for absorbing water and other minerals from the soil. The strength of the plant depends on the strength of the roots. Plants with weak roots fell during rain and heavy winds.`

        text: `Like our body a plant also has many parts. The main parts of a plant include root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seed. Each part has a set of jobs to do to keep the plant healthy.
Roots are found below the soil and it holds the plant firmly in its position. It absorbs the water and minerals from the soil. Sometimes it also stores food. Roots are of two main types: tap root and Ô¨Åbrous root.
The stem is the part that stays above the ground. A stem usually bears leaves, flowers and fruits. It distributes the water and minerals from the root to the leaves and flowers. The stem is the support system of the plant.
The leaves grow out of the side of the stem. Their main function is to make food for the plant by the process known as photosynthesis. Also they help in removing any excess water via stomata and this process is known as transpiration.
Flowers are the reproductive part of a plant. The flower has both female parts, called the pistil, and male parts, called the staemens. They work together to fertilize the plant and produce seeds.
The fruit is a fleshy or dry ripened part of a plant, enclosing the seed or seeds.
The hard part inside the fruit is called seed. Most plants grow from seeds.`
