        text: `# Day and Night 
          We live on the earth and the earth gets light from the sun. The earthâ€™s shape is like that of a very large ball. Therefore, light from the sun does not reach the entire earth at the same time. Half the earth gets sunlight while the other half remains dark.
          We say that it is day in the half of the earth that gets light, while in the other half where sunlight does not reach, it is night. Every day we see day chasing night and then night chasing day. Night comes after day and then day follows night. This cycle goes on without stopping.
          
          # Points to remember
          
          The sun rises in the east in the morning and moves towards the west. In the evening, the sun sets in the west. So we feel that the sun goes around the earth. But that is only an impression. The earth actually turns around itself. That is why we have day and night on the earth.
          This spinning of the earth around itself is called the rotation of the earth.
          
          # Duration of Day and Night
          
          In November, the days become shorter and shorter, while nights become longer. 
          In May, the days become longer and longer while the nights become shorter and shorter.
          On March 22, day and night are both 12 hours long. Then, in our part of the earth, daytime increases slowly and night time decreases. This goes on till June 21. 
          On June 21, our day is the longest and the night is the shortest. From June 21, in our part of the earth, daytime becomes shorter and shorter and nights become longer. This goes on till September 22. 
          On September 22, our day is of 12 hours and the night too is of 12 hours. After that, the days continue to become shorter. The nights become longer. This goes on till December 22.
          On December 22, our night is the longest and the day is the shortest. From December 22, the day grows longer and the night, shorter. This goes on till March 22. 
          From March 22, this cycle repeats itself.
          
          # Points to remember
          
          In the whole year, 22 March and 22 September are the only dates on which day and night are of equal length of 12 hours each.
          When the days are longer and the nights are shorter, it is summer.
          When the nights are longer and the days are shorter, it is winter.`
