    # Reproduction in Animals
    Reproduction is the biological process by which an organism gives rise to a new organism. There are two types of reproduction in animals: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction.              
    Sexual reproduction consists of the following stages:
    1. Pre-fertilization 
    2. Fertilization 
    3. Post-fertilization              
    Animals in which embryo develops outside the body are called oviparous animals, ex: Butterfly and Frogs. Animals in which the embryo develops inside the body are called viviparous animals. Humans, cows, deer and dogs are some examples.
    The type of reproduction in which only a single parent, gets divided into two new offspring, is known as asexual reproduction. There are four primary ways of asexual reproduction in animals: Fission, Budding, Fragmentation and Spore formation.
    # Conservation of Animals
    A National park is an area which is strictly reserved for the betterment of the wild life. The national parks cover an area of 100 â€“ 500 square kilometers. In these areas, private ownership rights are not allowed.              
    A sanctuary is a protected area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Harvesting of timber, collection of forest products and private ownership rights are allowed here.`
