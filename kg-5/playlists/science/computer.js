The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations.
1. Tally stick: A tally stick was an ancient memory aid device to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages
2. Abacus: An abacus is a mechanical device used to aid an individual in performing mathematical calculations. It was invented in Babylonia in 2400 B.C.  It is used to perform basic arithmetic operations.
3. Napierâ€™s Bones: Invented by John Napier in 1614. Allowed the operator to multiply, divide and calculate square and cube roots.
4. Slide Rule: Invented by William Oughtred in 1622. Not used for addition or subtraction. 
5. Pascaline: Invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642. It was limited to addition and subtraction. 
6. Stepped Reckoner: Invented by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1672. The machine that can add, subtract, multiply and divide automatically. 
7. Jacquard Loom: The Jacquard loom is a mechanical loom, invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard in 1881.  It is an automatic loom controlled by punched cards. 
8. Arithmometer: A mechanical calculator invented by Thomas de Colmar in 1820. The first reliable, useful, and commercially successful calculating machine.
9. Difference Engine and Analytical Engine: It is an automatic, mechanical calculator invented by Charles Babbage in 1822 and 1834. It was the first mechanical computer.
# Computer Generations         
There are five generations of computers.        
1. First-generation (1946 - 1958): The first computers used vacuum tubes and were very expensive. They relied on machine language and they could only solve one problem at a time.  The input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and the output was in form of printouts. Examples: ENIVAC and UNIVAC-1
2. Second-generation (1959 - 1964): Transistors replaced vacuum tubes. It allowed computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient, and more reliable. Second-generation computers used assembly languages. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory. Examples: IBM 1920, 1BM 1401, etc
3. Third-generation (1965 - 1970): The development of the integrated circuit increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience.
4. Fourth-generation (1971 - today): The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers. These small computers became more powerful. The concept of the Internet was introduced. 
5. Fifth-generation (Today to future): Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is still in development. `

Parts of Computer
1. CPU: It is the brain of the computer. It is the central processing unit. It helps in executing the instructions given by the user.   
2. Mouse:  It is used to pick items on the screen. When the mouse moves, the pointer also moves.
3. Keyboard: It has keys that we use to type numbers and letters. It helps in feeding information to the CPU. 
4. Monitor:  It displays words or pictures processed by a computer. It acts as a display screen.
5. Speaker:  It lets you to hear the sounds from a computer. Each notification has different tones.
6. Storage devices: It helps to store data. It is one of the core functions of the computer.
# Types of storage
1. Primary storage: these are also known as main memory. It includes RAM, ROM, Cache, etc
2. Secondary storage: The CPU cannot access the secondary storage directly. The computer's input or output channels are required to access it. Example: Hard disk
3. Tertiary storage: these are usually very slow and used to store data that is not used frequently. Examples: magnetic tape, optical disk, etc
4. Off-line storage: it is also known as disconnected storage. It is not under the control of the CPU. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator for the computer to access it. Examples: floppy disk, memory card, etc.



# Starting the computer
1. Plugin the computer and all the attached devices.
2. Switch on your UPS to provide an uninterrupted power supply to your computer.
3. Press the power button of the CPU to boot up the computer.
# Shutting down the computer
1. To turn off the computer click on the start button.
2. Then click shut down in the lower right corner of the start button.

Alphabetical keys: There are 26 alphabetical keys on the keyboard.
Numerical keys: There are 10 numerical keys on the keyboard.
Special keys: There are various special keys used to perform different functions.
# Different Special keys
Capslock: This key is used when we want to type a capital letter.
Enter key: It is used to finish a line and move to the next line on the page.
Shift key: It is a modifier key present on both sides of the keyboard. It is used to type capital letters and other alternate 'upper' characters.
# Different buttons on the mouse 
Left mouse button: It is used to point to any menu tool, icon, or for selection of text. We can select multiple entities using this button.
Scroll button: It is used to scroll the page up and down.
Right mouse button: It is used to invoke the shortcut menu.
# Advantages of Computer
1. It is much faster when compared to human beings.
2. It can perform all calculations accurately.
3. It can store large amounts of data.
4. It is more reliable than humans.
5. It can perform a variety of operations on the same set of data.
# Limitations of Computer
1. It has no IQ level.
2. It works on electricity.
3. It cannot think by itself.
