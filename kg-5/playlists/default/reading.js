        text: ` One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!
        The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.
        The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked! The crow drank the water happily and flew in the sky singing his favorite song.

He brought the woods back into the village and sold them to a merchant and earned his money. He earned just enough to make a living, and he was satisfied with his simple living.
        One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the river. The river was so deep, he could not take it on his own. He had only one axe that fell into the river. He started to worry. He will not be able to earn his living now! He was very sad and prayed to the God. He prayed sincerely and God appeared in front of him and asked, “What is the problem, my son?” The woodcutter explained the problem and requested the God to get his axe back.
        The God stretched his hand deep into the river and took out a silver axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The Woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. So, the God put his hand back deep into the water again and took a golden axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. The God said, “Take a look at it again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe. Are you sure, this is not yours?” The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine. I cannot cut trees with a golden axe. It’s not useful to me”.
        The God smiled and finally put his hand into the water again and took out his iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes! This is mine! Thank you!” The God was very impressed with his honesty and she gave him his iron axe and also the other two axes as a reward for his honesty.`,

        text: `Tenali Rama was an advisor to the King Krishna Devaraya. He was very clever and spontaneous. Sri Krishna Devaraya had some special type of brinjal plants in his garden. The brinjal was a very rare kind and the curry made out of it was very tasty which was loved by the king. As it was a rare type, the garden was guarded and no one was allowed to see the plants without the king’s permission.
        Once the emperor arranged an excellent dinner for his advisors and the brinjal curry was served. Tenali Rama enjoyed the brinjal curry very much and went home. But, he was unable to forget the taste. He told his wife about the taste of the curry. Tenali Rama’s wife also liked brinjal curry, she asked Tenali Rama to bring home few brinjals, so that she can prepare a curry. But, Tenali Rama knew that the king was taking extreme care about the brinjal plants and he can easily find out even if one brinjal was missing from his garden. And, the king would punish such a thief severely, if he was caught stealing a brinjal from his garden.
        But, Tenali’s wife pleaded him to bring a brinjal from the garden without telling anyone. Tenali Rama had no choice other than stealing a brinjal from the emperor’s garden. One night, he went to the garden, jumped over the wall and plucked few brinjals from the garden. Tenali Rama was happy that no one had seen him. His wife cooked the brinjals and the curry was very tasty. Like all mothers, she too loved her son very much and wanted to serve the brinjal curry to him. But, Tenali Rama asked her not to do such a thing, because if their son revealed to anyone that he had a rare brinjal curry, then they may get caught and get punished for stealing a brinjal from the garden.
        But his wife did not agree. She wanted to serve the curry to her son. She was unable to eat the curry alone without serving her little kid who was sleeping after doing his homework on the roof of their house. She asked Tenali Rama to find a way so that their son can also taste the brinjal curry. Tenali Rama also loved his son, so he thought of an idea. With hesitation, he went to the roof to wake up his child with a bucket of water, and poured the water on the child. When the child woke up, he said “It is raining. Let’s go inside the house and have dinner”. After going inside the room, he changed the clothes of his son and gave him the rice and brinjal curry for the dinner. Tenali Rama told his wife loudly that “it was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room”.
        Next day, the emperor came to know that few brinjals were missing in his garden. The Gardener who kept the count of each vegetable and flower found that three brinjals were missing. It became a challenging issue for the emperor and so he took it very seriously. He announced a reward for the person who can catch the thief. The gardener told the king that only Tenali Rama was capable of doing such things. The emperor sent a few policemen and asked Tenali Rama to come immediately. Once Tenali Rama came he asked him about the missing brinjals. Then Tenali Rama told, “I was not aware of the missing brinjals”. Then the gardener told “Tenali Rama was lying. Let’s enquire his son”.
        The king sent his policemen to bring Tenali Rama’s son. Once his son came, the king asked what vegetable he had for dinner last night. The child replied, “The brinjal curry and it was very tasty”. Then, the king told Tenali Rama that he must accept his crime. But Tenali Rama said his son slept very early, and he might be saying something which he saw in his dream.
        So, the king asked the little kid that “can you please explain clearly what you did yesterday after coming from the school?”
        Tenali Rama’s son replied that “yesterday after coming from the school, I played for some time and after that, I went on to the roof, did my homework, and slept on the roof. But when the rain started, my father came and woke me up. By that time my dress was fully wet, then we went inside, had dinner and slept again”.
        The gardener was shocked because there was no rain at all yesterday. So, they thought the kid had a dream and allowed Tenali Rama to go without any punishment. However, Tenali Rama told the truth to the king later, and was pardoned by the emperor for his clever witty idea.`,

The goat asked, “What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”
        The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and drink yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.
        Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then, I shall help you also to come out.” The goat was innocent and did not realise the cunningness of the fox, and so did as the fox said and helped him to get out of the well.

He said, “Alright, I will send my chief inspector to your house tomorrow morning at nine to inspect the horse there.” Tenali agreed.

Seeing the beard, the horse thought that it must be straw that was being given to him at the fixed time. It caught hold of the beard in his teeth and pulled. The inspector shouted in pain and tried to pull his beard back. But the horse knew that this was the only food he would get all day and pulled with all his might till the inspector lost his beard.

He boiled the milk and poured it in a pan. Then, he put this pan in front of the cat. As soon as the cat touched the boiling hot milk with its tongue, its tongue got burned and it ran away at once.
          Tenali repeated the same thing the next day and again the day after that. After a few days like that, the cat refused to touch the milk that was offered to it for fear of getting its mouth burned. In this way, Tenali got to drink all the milk himself.
          One day, the king ordered all the cats to be brought before him for inspection. While all cats were fat and healthy, Tenali’s cat looked thin and weak. The king was very angry with Tenali for not taking proper care of the cat. But Tenali pleaded, “Your Majesty, I cannot help it. My cat does not drink any milk at all.” The king said, “Nonsense, I will put you in prison for telling a lie.” Tenali requested the king to give him a chance to prove it and the king agreed.
          So, Tenali brought his cat and the pan of milk in front of the king. He offered milk to the cat. But on seeing the pan of milk, the cat ran away, frightened. The king was surprised at this but he let Tenali go. Tenali lived happily, drinking a lot of milk by himself.`

        text: `Once, a huge number of mice lived in a grocer’s shop. They ate the fresh, tasty wheat, rice, bread, cheese and biscuits that were kept in the shop. They were having a great time and living easy, comfortable lives, growing fatter day-by- day.
          But, the grocer was concerned about the loss that he was suffering, because of the damage done to his stock by the mice. So, he thought of a solution and bought a big, fat cat to keep in his shop.
          From that day onwards, the cat began to catch the mice every day. The mice were terrified of even stepping out of their holes. They could not reach the food anymore. This was a great cause of worry for them. They decided to call a meeting of all the mice in the shop to discuss this problem.
          They got together and started thinking. One of them suggested that they must get rid of the fat cat but no one could think of a way of doing so. So, they kept thinking of other ways. Finally, one mouse spoke up, “We should tie a bell around the cat’s neck. That way, whenever the cat is near or is coming in our direction, we would get to know by the ringing of the bell and we can quickly run back to our holes.”
          This idea was much appreciated by the other mice. They thought that this was the best plan. They began dancing and celebrating with joy. But their celebration did not last very long, for an old and experienced mouse said, “You fools! Stop celebrating and first tell me, who will bell the cat?”
          None of the mice had an answer to this question. They had not thought about this major problem in their plan. This is why it is said that making a plan is one thing but executing it is an entirely different thing.`

Terrified, he dashed into the house of a dye merchant and accidentally fell into a tub of blue dye. The jackal was stained blue from head to toe.
          Later, when he got back to the jungle, all the animals stared at him in shock. They had never seen such a strange and beautiful animal before. Seeing everyone confused the jackal thought of an idea. He proclaimed that he was sent to rule over the animal kingdom and guard its animals. The animals believed it and proclaimed him as their king.
          The jackal, as their king, then appointed the lion as his advisor, the tiger as his guardian, and the elephant as his doorkeeper. But, his work was not done. For the fear of being recognized, he drove all the jackals out of the forest. The new king, then, ordered his subjects to hunt for him and do his bidding. The animals used to bring all kinds of fruits and meat to him and the blue king lived a life of luxury.
          One day, as the blue king was enjoying himself, a pack of jackals passed by and began howling. Unable to control his natural instinct, the blue king rose up and howled to glory. Hearing his cry, the jungle animals realized that they had been fooled. At once, they chased the traitor out of the forest and the cunning jackal never returned again.`

          Soon, the geese rose into the sky, with the tortoise holding firmly onto the stick. “Remember! No talking!” said the geese to the tortoise. On witnessing this, animals on the ground started laughing at the unusual sight. “A flying tortoise!” they shouted. Unable to control his anxiety, the tortoise spoke out. “What’re you all laughing about? Oh no! I’m falling!” screamed the helpless tortoise.
          And so, the poor tortoise came crashing to the ground, only to be saved from death by her thick shell. “If only I would’ve kept my mouth shut, I would be in a new lake with my friends,” thought the tortoise, as she slowly began her journey to find her friends.`

Just then, he saw a crow sitting on a branch. The crow had a cream biscuit in his beak which he had snatched away from a little boy. The fox’s mouth started watering on seeing the biscuit. He started thinking of a way of getting the biscuit for himself.
          The fox said to the crow, “Dear crow, the lion king told me that you sing beautifully. But I have never heard your voice. Will you sing a song for me?” The crow was so pleased on hearing the flattering words of the fox, he immediately opened his beak and began, “Caw,caw, caw.” As soon as the crow opened his beak, the cream biscuit fell down. The cunning fox immediately munched it up and went off.
          The next day, the fox came across the crow again. This time, the crow had a piece of cake in his mouth. The fox also wanted that cake. He said, “Dear crow, please forgive me about yesterday. Your song was so sweet and I really wanted to hear the whole song but I spotted a rabbit nearby, so I ran away. Please sing that song for me again.” But the crow understood the trick of the fox. He flew off towards his nest with the piece of cake in his beak. After keeping the cake safely in his nest, he returned to where he was sitting and began singing loudly, “Caw, caw, caw.” The fox could not bear to listen to the crow’s voice and ran away.

          The stork thought of a plan. He stood by the tank with a sad look on his face. He did not attempt to catch any fish. The fish, frogs and crabs in the tank noticed it, and asked him what the matter was.
          “I heard that some humans will soon fill this tank and grow crops over it. There will not be any fish left alive. This makes me feel sad”, replied the stork. The fish were worried and asked the stork to help them.
          The stork offered to take all of them to a bigger tank some distance away. But since he was old, he would need to rest between trips and would be able to carry only a few fish at a time. Saying this he set out on his first trip taking a few fish in his beak. However, he did not go to another tank. Instead he took them to a bog rock and ate them there. Each time he was hungry he would take a trip with a few more fishes.
          A crab was left in the tank. He also wanted to save himself and requested the stork to take him also. The stork felt he could try a different meal for a change. He agreed to take the crab. The stork flew up with him. After a while, the crab looked down to see the tank where he was going to, but all he could see was dry land.
          “Uncle, where is the big tank you are taking me to?” he asked. The stork laughed and pointed to a rock below. There were heaps of fish-bones on the rock. The crab realized that he was going to be the stork’s next meal. He thought quickly of a way to save himself. The crab dug his sharp claws into the stork’s neck and did not let go till the stork fell down dead. He then cut off the stork’s head and dragged it to the tank he lived in. There he told everyone how the stork had been cheating everyone and how he had killed him.`

          One day, a turtle came to them and said, "I also want to join your company and become your friend. I'm all alone. "
          "You're most welcome," said the crow. "But, what about your personal safety, there are many hunters around. They visit this jungle regularly. Suppose, a hunter comes, how will you save yourself?"
          "That is the reason why I want to join your group," said the turtle
          No sooner had they talked about it, a hunter appeared on the scene. Seeing the hunter, the deer darted away; the crow flew in the sky and the mouse ran into a hole. The turtle tried to crawl away fast, but he was caught by the hunter. The hunter tied him up in the net. He was sad to lose the deer. But he thought, it was better to feast on the turtle rather than to go hungry.
          The turtle's three friends became much worried to see his friend trapped by the hunter. They sat together to think of some plan to free his friend from the hunter's snare.
          The crow, then, flew high up in the sky and spotted the hunter walking along the river bank. As per the plan, the deer ran ahead of the hunter unnoticed and lay on the hunter's path as if dead.
          The hunter saw the deer from a distance, lying on the ground. He was very happy to have found it again. "Now I'll have a good feast on it and sell its beautiful skin in the market," thought the hunter.  He put down the turtle on to the ground and ran to pick up the deer.
          In the meantime, as planned, the mouse gnawed through the net and freed the turtle. The turtle hurriedly crawled away into the river water.
          Unaware of the plot of these friends, the hunter went to fetch the deer for its tasty flesh and beautiful skin. But, what he saw with his mouth wide open was that, when he reached near, the deer suddenly sprang up to its feet and darted away into the jungle. Before he could understand anything, the deer disappeared.
          Dejected, the hunter turned back to collect the turtle he had left behind on the ground in the snare. But he was shocked to see the snare lying nibbled at and the turtle missing. For a moment, the hunter thought that he was dreaming. But the damaged snare lying on the ground was proof enough to confirm that he was very much awake and he was compelled to believe that some miracle had taken place.
          The hunter got frightened on account of these happenings and ran out of the jungle. The four friends once again started living happily.`

        text: `Once upon a time, there lived a wealthy merchant, in a village. He ran a big business. His village was situated near a river. Once, due to heavy rain, the river was flooded. One night, the whole village was submerged in neck deep water. The crops, houses and factories in the village were destroyed and hundreds of people and cattle perished in the flood.
          The merchant had to suffer heavy losses in his business. He decided to shift to some other town to try his luck. His plan was to earn a lot of money and then come back to his native village to start his business again.
          The merchant had a heavy iron balance lying with him. It belonged to his ancestors. It was not possible for him to carry such a heavy thing along with him. So, before starting on his journey, he decided to keep this ancestral item with his friend Ravi. He met Ravi and requested him, "My friend, as you know, I'm leaving for some distant place to earn money, so that I could start my business once again when I come back. I have an old iron balance with me. Will you please keep it safe with you till I return?"
          Ravi readily agreed to his friend's request and said, "Don't worry, I'll keep it safe for you. You can take it back after you return home." The merchant thanked Ravi for his helping attitude. He kept the iron balance with Ravi and left for some other distant town.
          A few years passed by. By this time, the merchant had done good business and had earned a lot of money. He returned to his native village, and went to his friend Ravi's house to meet him. Ravi showed his happiness in meeting the merchant. Both the friends talked together for hours. When it was time to leave, the merchant asked his friend to return his iron balance. At this, Ravi looked sad and said, "Friend, I am sorry to say that I don't have your balance with me anymore. There are a lot of mice in my house. They ate up your balance."
          The merchant was surprised to hear Ravi's explanation. 'How can mice eat iron,' he thought to himself, but apparently he said something different, "Don't feel sorry, Ravi. The mice have always proved a menace to everyone. Let us forget about it."
          "Yes," Ravi said. "This is the only way out." He was happy that the merchant believed his words. In fact he had expected a lot of heated arguments in this respect.
          While taking leave from his friend, the merchant said to Ravi, "I'm going to temple to make an offering of laddoos. Could you please send your son with me. I would like to send some laddoos for you also. He would also look after my shoes outside the temple while I offer prayers inside.
          Ravi asked his son to go along with the merchant. Then, the merchant, instead of taking Ravi's son to temple, took him to a nearby hill and tied him with a big rock and came back home.
          When Ravi didn't see his son return, he asked the merchant where his son was. "I'm sorry," said the merchant. "While your son was looking after my shoes outside the temple, a big vulture swooped down upon him and carried him away."
          "What nonsense!" shouted Ravi. "How can a vulture carry off a young boy?" But the merchant repeatedly claimed that a vulture carried away Ravi's son. The argument reached such a point that they began quarrelling with each other, using dirty words.
          Ultimately the matter had to be taken to the court. The Judge listened to both the parties and ordered the merchant to bring Ravi's son to the court, otherwise, he would be sent to jail.
          "My Lord", said the merchant, "How can I, when a vulture has already carried away the boy."
          "Shut up!" the judge reprimanded the merchant. "How can a bird carry away a young boy?"
          "It can, my lord," said the merchant. "If mice can eat my iron balance, why can't a bird carry away a grown up boy." Then he narrated the whole story to the judge.
          The judge then asked Ravi to tell the truth. He warned him that if he didn't tell the truth he would be sent to prison. At last, Ravi admitted his guilt. The judge ordered him to return the iron balance to the merchant. He asked the merchant to return the boy to Ravi.`

        text: `There lived a huge elephant in a dense jungle. He was cruel and arrogant by nature. He roamed freely in the jungle, pulling down small trees and branches. Those animals who lived in the trees were very much afraid of this elephant. When he pulled down the trees and tore off the branches, many-a-nest with eggs and nestlings came down crashing on the ground and got destroyed. His movement in the jungle created an all round havoc. Even the tigers and lions kept themselves at a safe distance from this rogue. In his ruthless march in the jungle, many holes of the foxes were trampled. This led to dissatisfaction among the foxes and among the other animals alike. Many of them wanted to kill the elephant. But this task was very difficult, because of his huge size.
          "He is so huge", said the foxes amongst themselves. "It's nearly impossible to kill him."
          Then a meeting of all the foxes was called. In the meeting, the impossible task was assigned to a very cunning fox. The fox, before executing his plan studied the elephant's behaviour for many days.
          One day, the fox went to meet the elephant and said to him, "Your Highness. It's urgent to talk to you. It's a matter of life and death for us."
          The elephant trumpeted at his highest pitch and asked, "Who're you and why do you want to see me?"
          "Your Highness", said the fox. "I'm the representative of the whole of the animal community. We want to make you our supreme head - the king. Kindly accept our offer."
          
          The elephant lifted his trunk with great pride and asked for details.
          The fox further explained, "I’ve come to take you with me. The coronation ceremony will take place in the middle of the jungle, where thousands of animals have already gathered and are chanting holy mantras."
          The elephant was very glad to hear this. He had always cherished a dream to become a king. He thought that the coronation ceremony will be a matter of pride to him. He readied himself hurriedly to accompany the fox to the deep jungle.
          "Come, Your Highness," said the fox. "Follow me."
          The fox led the elephant to some imaginary spot of ceremony. On their way, they had to walk through a swampy area by the side of a pond. The fox being light bodied, crossed the small swampy patch without any difficulty. The elephant too walked on it, but being heavily built, he got stuck in the swamp. The more he tried to come out of the swamp, the more he went deep into it. He became scared and called out the fox, "Dear friend. Please help me. I'm sinking in the mud. What'll happen to my coronation now? Call your other friends also to help me."
          "I'm not going to save you", said the fox. "You deserve this treatment. You know, how cruel you have been to other animals all along. You pulled down branches of trees mercilessly, without caring for the eggs and for the lives of the nestlings. You knew everything, but remained indifferent. You trampled upon the burrows of the foxes. You saw our siblings being crushed under your heavy feet. You saw us crying, begging for mercy; but nothing bothered you. And now you are begging for your life? I am sorry to tell you that though, your coronation couldn't take place, but your cremation will definitely take place." And the fox left.
          The elephant couldn't come out of the swamp and died there.

          Even after selling the well to the farmer, Iqbal continued to fetch water from the well. Angered by this, the farmer had come to get justice from King Akbar. King Akbar asked Iqbal the reason for fetching water from the well even after selling it to the farmer. Iqbal replied that he had sold only the well to the farmer but not the water inside it.
          King Akbar wanted Birbal who was present in the court listening to the problem to solve the dispute. Birbal came forward and gave a solution. He said,
          "Iqbal, You say that you have sold only the well to the farmer. And you claim that the water is yours. Then how come you can keep your water inside another person's well without paying rent?"
          Iqbal's trickery was countered thus in a tricky way. The farmer got justice and Birbal was fairly rewarded.`

The travellers answered that they were making "stone soup", which tasted wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needed a little bit of garnish, which they were missing, to improve the flavour.
          The villager, who wanted to get a share of the soup, did not mind parting with a few carrots. So they were added to the soup. Another villager walked by, inquiring about the pot, and the travellers again mentioned their stone soup which had not yet reached its full potential.
          The villager handed them a little bit of seasoning. More and more villagers walked by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible) was removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup was enjoyed by the travellers and villagers alike.

He could not think of any way of getting down without injuring himself seriously.
          He asked the people who were passing by to help him. But nobody could think of a way of bringing him down safely. Soon, quite a few people gathered around the tree and tried to help the man, but no one knew what to do. The man remained stuck on top of the tree.
          Just then, Mulla, who was walking by, saw this scene and wondered what was going on. The people standing around the tree told Mulla about the situation. “Oh!” Mulla said, “I’ll get him down in no time.” He took a long rope and threw one end of it up to the man telling him to tie the rope around his waist.
          Everyone wondered what Mulla’s plan was. When one of them asked him, Mulla replied, “Just leave it to me. It’s a great plan.”
          When the man on the tree had tied the rope tightly around his waist, Mulla pulled the rope with all his force. As soon as Mulla did this, the man fell down from the tree and hurt himself badly. The bystanders were shocked at this. They turned to Mulla and asked, “What did you do? What a silly plan you had?”
          Mulla replied, “Well, once I did exactly the same thing and saved someone’s life.” One man asked him, “Is that true?” “Absolutely!” replied Mulla, “The only difference was I saved him from a well and not a tree.”`
