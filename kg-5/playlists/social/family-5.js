        text: `# Decision making
We live together in a family. Every person has their own likes and dislikes. Thoughts and opinions can also differ. So, when everyone has a role in decision making, each person gets the opportunity to say what they think. We feel like a more important part of the family when we see that our opinion is valued.
# Honesty
Everyone makes mistakes. When we realize that we have made a mistake, we should talk about it openly with our friends and family. It will help us correct our mistake. It will also teach us to be honest. It is necessary to be honest and sincere in our work. Because, if we are dishonest, we lose our self-confidence.
# Co-operation
Co-operation and teamwork help us communicate with more people, learn together and get work done easily and efficiently. For example, we co-operate in family, team sports, rallies and other gatherings.
# Tolerance
Tolerance is when you try to understand another person's point of view even if their opinion doesn't match with yours. It means you respect their ideas and thoughts.
# Gender Equality
Gender equality means considering boys and girls as equally capable in all aspects, like sports, education, jobs, opportunities, responsibilities, etc. Both genders must respect one another.
# Points to remember
1. Everyone in the family must have a say in decision-making.
2. We must be honest in our private and public life.
3. Tolerance and co-operation make our life peaceful.
4. A tolerant attitude makes it easy to preserve diversity.
5. Men and women are equal. It is not right to discriminate between them.
# Rules
Our society works according to certain rules. We make the rules ourselves. We follow these rules because they are meant for the common good. Sometimes laws have to be made to abolish unjust customs. In our country, customs such as child labour and child marriage were abolished by making laws that banned them.
# Points to remember
1. Everyone has a responsibility to solve problems in civic life.
2. Problems can be solved if everyone co-operates.
3. Dialogue and discussion can help solve disputes.
4. Disputes can be solved peacefully.
5. If there is peace in the family, school and society, everyone benefits.
6. Peace is a social value.`
