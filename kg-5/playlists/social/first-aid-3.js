The immediate help that can be given to an injured person before further treatment is called first aid. After giving first aid an injured person must be immediately taken to the hospital. First aid plays an important role in everyday life. The type of first aid given varies for different injuries.

1. You must wash your hands thoroughly before giving first aid to an injured person.
2. In case of a deep wound, first remove all the dirt from areas around the wound.
3. Then clean the skin around the wound with a cotton swab dipped in antiseptic lotion.
4. Now tie a bandage around the wound to stop bleeding.
5. In case of a small wound use a band-aid to cover the wound.

2. Apply an ice pack on the burnt area for a few minutes.
3. Apply an antiseptic cream on the burned area.

First Aid is given in order to 
1. To save life: First aid given to a patient at the right time can save his life even before taking him to the hospital.

# Snake Bite
When a snake bites someone, it injects poison into the victim. The poison enters the bloodstream and affects the entire body.
1. Donâ€™t move the victim as it causes the poison to spread faster.
2. Tie a piece of cloth on the bitten part to slow down the movement of the infected blood towards the heart.
3. Take the victim to a doctor immediately.
4. Anti-venom injection to be given to the victim.
#  Fracture
Fracture is caused when a bone in the body breaks. A fracture can occur anywhere e.g. while playing or falling from a tree.
1. Ensure not to move the fractured part.
2. Use a splint to give support and prevent the movement of the fractured part e.g. a piece of cardboard can be tied around the injured part.
3. Take the patient to the doctor immediately.`
