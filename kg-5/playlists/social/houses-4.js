# Tree house
These houses are built by the people in jungles to protect them from wild animals. They are built on trees. A platform is first constructed on the tree at the required height. The trunk of the tree itself becomes the pillar for the platform. The light-weight wood is used for building the rest of the house. A ladder is used to enter the house. During the night, the ladder is removed to protect from animals.

Pillars are raised from the foundation and the building will stand on the strength of pillars. This type of houses are usually found in cities where there is large population and less space.

        text: `# What is House?
It shelters us, protects us from almost all threats, gives us protection against wild animals, global warming, anti-social elements, etc., and is a relaxing place to live. In ancient times, humans lived in caves. As time passed, they slowly evolved and constructed their houses according to their comfort.
# Different types of houses
Different types of houses are built according to the climate and region. For example, house structure varies in plains, marshy areas, heavy rainfall regions, mountains, deserts, etc.  The structure of the houses varies from the region to region. So, people build houses that are suitable for the climate and natural resources. Building materials for construction differ for each type of house.  Moreover, one can see the different types of houses in cities and villages.  For example, you can see houses like mud houses, huts, bungalows, apartments, independent houses, etc. 
# People and their houses
Food, water, clothing, and shelter are more important basic things for human beings. The shelter is needed for every living thing. Due to some reason, some people lack their basic needs. These people live the homeless life. They are seeking shelter in subways, roadside pathways, under bridges, open grounds, etc. It is a serious social problem, that these kinds of people leading their life with insufficient livelihood. To eradicate this problem, our government is introducing  many schemes and taking huge steps to fulfill the basic needs of these people. 
# Depletion of natural resources
The world population is increasing day by day. As a result, the number of houses are increasing. Natural resources are used in large amounts to fulfill mankind’s needs. For example, extracting sand from riverbeds, cutting down trees to clear the land, digging more hills for quarrying, and using exhaustible sources of energy. Using plenty of natural resources for a long time will put our world in danger. For urbanization development, many agricultural lands, forests are destroyed and natural resources are getting wasted. Usually, to form the exhaustible sources in nature, it will lakhs of time. So, it is in our hands, to protect our environment and natural resources.
# Home Sweet Home
It is our responsibility to save and protect natural resources and the environment. So that future generations can use this utility well. It is necessary to construct eco–friendly houses and should increase the use of non-exhaustible sources of energy.  Recycling water, garbage, avoiding plastics, artificial materials, and colors will help in the protection of our environment.`
