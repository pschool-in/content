          # Snake Bite
          When a snake bites someone, it injects poison into the victim. The poison enters the blood stream and affects the entire body.
          1. Donâ€™t move the victim as it causes the poison to spread faster.
          2. Tie a piece of cloth on the bitten part to slow down the movement of the infected blood towards the heart.
          3. Take the victim to a doctor immediately.
          4. Anti-venom injection to be given to the victim.
          #  Fracture
          Fracture is caused when a bone in the body breaks. A fracture can occur anywhere e.g. while playing or falling from a tree.
          1. Ensure not to move the fractured part.
          2. Use a splint to give support and prevent the movement of the fractured part e.g. a piece of cardboard can be tied around the injured part.
          3. Take the patient to the doctor immediately.`
