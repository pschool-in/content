In very ancient times, man used to hunt animals and used to eat raw meat, raw vegetables, root, fruits, bulbs, etc., for food. They kept moving from one place to another for their survival. After long years, slowly they start to learn and develop themselves in different activities like agriculture, weaving, jewel making, etc. So, the people started to settle in the places where they felt more comfortable. Slowly, they settled and started to live together. They helped each other and divided work among themselves. These settlements were helped to form the village/ town. Besides, this made the people engaged in different occupations.
