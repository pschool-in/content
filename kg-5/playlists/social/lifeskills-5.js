        text: `Human nature has many different aspects. At times, he is jealous; at times he is loving. Sometimes, he acts selfishly, but sometimes he is willing to make a sacrifice for others and comes forward to help. Anger, joy, sorrow, jealousy, disappointment, fear, etc. are all emotions.
# Coping with our Emotions
If someone does something wrong, we get angry; however, we must not lose our temper. It is natural to desire something but we must not be greedy for it. If we think properly, we can control our emotions. Emotional adjustment involves coping with your emotions, being able to control them and expressing them in a reasonable manner.
When we learn to cope with our emotions, our personality becomes balanced, our ability to understand others increases and we can overcome adverse conditions. Then we become free from faults such as blaming others unnecessarily, calling them names and not being able to tolerate their success. We become happy and our ability to relate to others improves. We learn not to be stubborn.
# Anger
Anger is an emotion just like happiness or sadness. All of us get angry about something at some point of time. We get angry if something does not happen according to our wishes, or if we are insulted. Similarly, we also get angry if we see someone being ill-treated. If we get angry very often, or if we cannot control our anger, it can have adverse effects on our body and mind. We become short-tempered and stubborn. Our attitude of co-operation and understanding decreases and we hurt others. We face consequences such as headache, loss of sleep and dullness.
# Flaws
Peopleâ€™s likes and dislikes and capabilities can be different. We may be good at some subject, art or sport and bad at another. We must know our flaws as well as our talents, so that we can improve upon them. Just because we are unable to do something, it does not mean that we stop trying to excel at what we can do.
# We can change
No person is entirely good or entirely bad. We must always think about the good qualities or virtues in our friends first. We must help each other to get rid of our flaws. If we speak about our flaws as openly as we speak about our talents, it will be to our advantage.
Neha talks the most in her group. Her friends began to avoid her since they never got a chance to speak. Neha realized this. Then, she began to watch out how much she spoke. She told her friends herself, 'Stop me if I talk too much'. Gradually, Neha began to listen to others and brought about a change in her own behaviour.
# Recap
1. Emotions must be expressed. There must be a balance between our thoughts and emotions.
2. Anger must be controlled, otherwise it can have adverse effects on our mind and body.
3. We must be aware of our flaws as well as our talents.
4. We can try to correct the flaws in our nature.`

2. If we are aware of the flaws in the construct of our nature, then we should try to correct ourselves. Moreover, we should help each other to get rid of the flaws. We should stop identifying negative qualities people have and rather seek positive ones.          
3. Too much of anger will lead to adverse effects on mental and physical health. Sometimes, it also leads to violence. Being stubborn is a sign of ego and pride and it will lead to many problems.So, we should try to tolerate things and must not lose the temper. One can have desire in their life, but should not be greedy about it.          
4. Sometimes we get hurt by others, intentionally or unintentionally. Some people take revenge in hurting us back, which is very bad quality. Controlling our emotions is the important aspect in our life. It is best way to express the emotions in a reasonable manner.`

        text: `All living things have the ability to grow. Humans have slow growth and development from birth to adulthood. Infants cannot do any activity by themselves. Slowly they get the co-ordination and control of the movements. They grow in weight and height slowly till adulthood. A balanced diet and regular exercise are the major factors that support growth and development for humans.          
# Skills development          
When we grow, our physical strength increases. At the same time, learning and practicing new skills rapidly leads to personality development. Animals learn from their mother how to protect themselves from their enemies, weather, etc. They learn and begin to live independently. Animals learn only a limited number of skills in their life, however, humans learn more things throughout their life. Developing skills helps one to live independently and enrich life.           
# Heredity          
The characteristics and features of parents or ancestors that are being passed to their children is called heredity. This is the reason, where many family members look similar to each other, but even then every person is unique. Everyone has their unique character traits and personality. Talents and inherent qualities differ from person to person.`
