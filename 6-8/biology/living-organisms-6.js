        text: `# Organism and their Surroundings
Organisms of various kinds are seen in each habitat be it cold, hot, dry or humid. In the desert we can see camels, the mountains have goats and yak, on the beach there are crabs and some creatures like ants are seen in all these different locations. The kinds of plants found in the different regions are also different from one another.

# Habitat and Adaptation
In the sea, plants and animals are surrounded by saline or salty water. These organisms use air dissolved in water. In a desert, very little water is available, it is very hot during the day and very cold at night. The animals and plants live on desert soil and breathe air from the surroundings. 
The presence of specific features or certain habits, which enable an organism to live naturally in a place is called adaptation. Adaptation of organisms differs depending on their place of dwelling. The place where organisms live is called habitat. The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. The habitat of plants and animals that live in water are called aquatic habitats.
The organisms, both plants and animals, living in a habitat are its biotic components. The non-living things such as rocks, soil, air and water in the habitat constitute its abiotic components. Abiotic factors like air, water, light and heat are important for all living organisms.

# Characteristics of Organisms

1. All organisms need food to survive.
2. All living organisms show growth.
3. All living organisms respire.
4. All living organisms respond to stimuli. Changes in our surroundings that makes us respond to them, are called stimuli.
5. All living organisms excrete. The process of getting rid of wastes by organisms is known as excretion.
6. All living organisms reproduce. Living things produce more of their own kind through reproduction.
7. All living organisms show some kind of movement. Plants are generally anchored in soil so they do not move from one place to another. However, various substances like water, minerals and the food synthesized by them move from one part of the plant to another. `,

The body structure of a camel helps it to survive in desert conditions. Camels have long legs which help to keep their bodies away from the heat of the sand. They excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry and they do not sweat. Since camels lose very little water from their bodies, they can live for many days without water. The desert animals like rats and snakes that do not have long legs which camels have to stay away from the intense heat during the day by staying in burrows deep in the sand. These animals come out only during the night when it is cooler. Desert plants lose very little water through transpiration. The leaves in desert plants are either absent, very small, or they are in the form of spines. This helps in reducing the loss of water from the leaves through transpiration. The leaf-like structure you see in a cactus is its stem. Photosynthesis in these plants is usually carried out by the stems. The stem is also covered with a thick waxy layer, which helps to retain water in the tissues of cacti. Most desert plants have roots that go very deep into the soil to absorb water.

# Mountains
These habitats are normally very cold and windy. In some areas, snowfall may take place in winter. There is a large variety of plants and animals living in the mountain regions. The trees are normally cone-shaped and have sloping branches. The leaves of some of these trees are needle-like. This helps the rainwater and snow to slide off easily. There are trees with different shapes in the mountains. They have different kinds of adaptation to survive on the mountain. Animals have thick skin or fur to protect them from cold. Yaks have long hair to keep them warm. Snow leopard has thick fur on its body including feet and toes. This protects its feet from the cold when it walks in the snow. The mountain goat has strong hooves for running up the rocky slopes of the mountains. As we go up in the mountains, the surroundings change and we see different kinds of adaptations at different heights.

# Grasslands
A lion lives in a forest or grassland and is a strong animal that can hunt and kill animals like deer. It is light brown. Its light brown color helps it to hide in dry grasslands when it hunts its prey. The eyes in front of the face allow it to have a correct idea about the location of its prey. A deer is another animal that lives in forests and grasslands. It has strong teeth for chewing hard plant stems in the forest. A deer needs to know about the presence of predators in order to run away from them and not become their prey. It has long ears to hear the movements of predators. The eyes on the side of its head allow it to look in all directions for danger. The speed of the deer helps them to run away from the predators. There are many other features of a lion, a deer or other animals and plants that help them to survive in their habitat.

# Oceans
The body structure of a fish is streamlined which helps them to swim. They have slippery scales on their bodies which protect the fish and also help in movement. They have flat fins and tails that help them change direction and keep their body balanced in water. Gills help to use oxygen dissolved in water. There are some sea animals like squids and octopuses, which do not have this streamlined shape. They stay deeper in the ocean, near the seabed and catch any prey that moves towards them. However, when they move in water they make their body shapes streamlined. These animals have gills to help them use oxygen dissolved in water. Dolphins and whales do not have gills. They breathe in air through nostrils or blowholes that are located on the upper parts of their heads. This allows them to breathe in air when they swim near the surface of the water. They can stay inside the water for a long time without breathing. They come out to the surface from time to time, to breathe in air.

# Ponds and lakes
In terrestrial plants, roots normally play a very important role in the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil. However, in aquatic plants, roots are much reduced in size and their main function is to hold the plant in place. The stems of these plants are long, hollow and light. The stems grow up to the surface of the water while the leaves and flowers, float on the surface of water. Some aquatic plants are submerged in water. All parts of such plants are underwater. Some of these plants have narrow and thin ribbon-like leaves. These can bend in the flowing water. In some submerged plants, leaves are often highly divided, through which the water can easily flow without damaging them. Frogs usually live in ponds. Frogs can stay both inside the water as well as move on land. They have strong back legs that help them in leaping and catching their prey. They have webbed feet which help them swim in water. `,
