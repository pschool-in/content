        text: `# Dealing with garbage
Safai karamcharis collect the garbage in trucks and take it to a low lying open area called landfill. The part of the garbage that can be reused is separated out from the one that cannot be used as such. The non-useful component is separated out. It is then spread over the landfill and covered with a layer of soil. Once the landfill is completely full, it is converted to a park or playground. Useful components are used to make compost.

# Vermicomposting
The method of preparing compost with the help of redworms is called vermicomposting.

# Steps in vermicomposting
1. Spread a net or sand at bottom of a pit.
2. Spread vegetable waste.
3. Sprinkle some water.
4. Add redworms.
5. Cover loosely with gunny bag, old cloth or grass.
6. Vermicompost ready within 3-4 weeks.

# Redworms
Redworms do not have teeth. They have a structure called gizzard, which helps them in grinding their food. Powdered egg shells or sea shells could be mixed with the wastes. This would help redworms in grinding their food. A redworm can eat food equal to its own weight, in a day. Redworms do not survive in very hot or very cold surroundings. They also need moisture around them. If you take good care of your worms, in a monthâ€™s time their number will double.

# Think and Throw
The garbage can be sorted before it is disposed off. Things that can be recycled like paper and things that can be reused needs to be separated out to reduce the bulk of garbage.

# Recycling of Paper
Old newspapers, magazines, used envelopes, notebooks and any other paper materials can be recycled to obtain useful products. The paper can be torn, made into a paste by submerging in water for a day and then spread on wire mesh and dried in the sun to form recycled paper.

# Plastics
Some plastics can be recycled but not all. Consuming food packed in reused plastic is harmful for our health. All kind of plastics give out harmful gases, upon heating or burning. These gases may cause many health problems, including cancer, in humans. Stray animals may swallow plastics bags and sometimes die due to this. Plastics may enter sewer system and block drains. `,
