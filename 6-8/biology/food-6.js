        text: `# Food variety
There is so much variety in the food we eat. Some dishes only require two materials or ingredients whereas some food items are made with many ingredients. Some ingredients we use in our daily lives are salt, sugar, spices, rice, vegetables, oil etc.

# Food materials and sources
Plants are the sources of food ingredients like grains, cereals, vegetables and fruits. Animals provide us with milk, meat products and eggs. Cows, goats and buffaloes are some common animals that give us milk. Milk and milk products like butter, cream, cheese and curd are used all over the world.

# Plant products and Animal products as food
Plants are one source of our food. We eat fruits of some plants and leafy vegetables of some other plants. Sometimes we also consume roots, stems and even flowers of plants. Some plants have more than one edible part. For example, the seeds of mustard plants give us oil and the leaves are used as a vegetable. Some common animal products we eat are eggs, milk and honey. Bees collect nectar from flowers, convert it into honey and store it in their hive. We collect the food stored by the bees as honey and use it as an ingredient.

# What do animals eat?
Animals that eat only plants are called herbivores. Animals that eat only animals are called carnivores. Animals that eat both plants as well as other animals are called omnivores. `,

        text: `# What do different food items contain?
Every dish contains one or more ingredients which may be plant or animal-based. These ingredients contain some components that are needed by our body called nutrients. The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. In addition, food contains dietary fibres and water which are also needed by our body.

# Test for Carbohydrate
First, a dilute solution of iodine is prepared by adding a few drops of tincture iodine to a test tube half-filled with water. Now take a small quantity of food item or a raw ingredient and add 2-3 drops of dilute iodine solution. A blue-black color change indicates the presence of starch.

# Test for Protein
A copper sulfate solution is prepared by dissolving 2 grams of copper sulfate in 100 milliliters of water. Then dissolve 10 grams of caustic soda in 100 ml of water. Take a small quantity of food item, grind to paste and add 10 drops of water to make a paste. To this add two drops of copper sulphate and ten drops of caustic soda. A violet color indicates the presence of proteins.

# Test for Fat
Take a small quantity of a food item. Wrap it on a piece of paper and crush it. Take care that the paper does not tear. An oily patch on paper shows that the food item contains fat. The food items may sometimes contain a little water. Therefore, after you have rubbed an item on paper, let the paper dry for a while. If there were any water that may have come from food, it would dry up after some time. If no oily patch shows up after this, the food item does not contain any fat.

# What do various nutrients do for our body?
Carbohydrates mainly provide energy to our body. Fats also give us energy. In fact, fats give much more energy as compared to the same amount of carbohydrates. Foods containing fats and carbohydrates are also called ‘energy-giving foods’. Proteins are needed for the growth and repair of our body. Proteins are often called ‘bodybuilding foods’. Vitamins help protect our bodies against diseases. Vitamins also help keep our eyes, bones, teeth and gums healthy. Minerals are needed by our bodies in small amounts. Besides these nutrients, our body needs dietary fiber and water. Roughage does not provide any nutrients to our body but helps our body get rid of undigested food. Water helps our body to absorb nutrients from food. It also helps in throwing out some wastes from the body as urine and sweat.

# Balanced Diet
For growth and maintenance of good health, our diet should have all the nutrients that our body needs, in the right quantities.  The diet should also contain a good amount of roughage and water. Such a diet is called a balanced diet. It can be very harmful to us to eat too much fat-rich foods and we may end up suffering from a condition called obesity.

# Deficiency Diseases
Diseases that occur due to a lack of nutrients over a long period are called deficiency diseases. If a person does not get enough proteins in their food for a long time, they are likely to have stunted growth, swelling of the face discoloration of hair, skin diseases and diarrhea. If the diet is deficient in both carbohydrates and proteins for a long period of time, the growth may stop completely. Such a person becomes very lean and thin and so weak that he/she may not even be able to move. Deficiency of different vitamins and minerals may also result in certain diseases or disorders.`
