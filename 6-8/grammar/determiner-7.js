          `# Types of Determiners
1. Articles: Articles can be definite articles (the) or indefinite (a or an). 'The' is used when the speaker thinks that the listener already knows what is being referred to. Otherwise, 'a' (before consonants) or 'an' (before vowels) is used.`,
          {

  There's <b>an</b> otter over there.<br>
  <b>The</b> beaches in Goa are beautiful.<br>
  I'll give you <b>an</b> example of <b>the</b> essay question.`
          },
          `2. Demonstratives: Demonstrative determiners are used to identify or point to a particular person, event, or object. 'This' and 'that' is singular. 'These' and 'those' are plural.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: I like <b>this</b> kind of biscuit.<br>
  Why don't you buy <b>that</b> book instead of this one?<br>
  <b>Those</b> children outside are being too noisy for this time of night.<br>
  I'll take <b>these</b> pills for my backache later.`
          },
          `3. Possessive Adjectives: Possessive adjective determiners function as adjectives rather than pronouns. As they are adjectives, they appear before the noun that they are modifying.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: Do you like <b>my</b> new dress?<br>
  I prefer <b>my</b> uniform to <b>yours<b>.<br>
  Take <b>your</b> phone out of <b>your</b> pocket.`
          },
          `4. Quantifiers: Quantifiers provide approximate or specific answers to the questions "How many?" and "How much?"`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: I only take <b>a little</b> bit of milk with my tea.<br>
  Quite <b>a few</b> people should be coming to the party.<br>
  I didn't take <b>many</b> holidays last year.<br>
  I haven't brought <b>much</b> money with me.<br>
  Do you think <b>a lot of</b> people believe what he says?<br>
  <b>Most</b> students work hard to pass their exams.<br>
  Have you got <b>any</b> proof that he committed the crime?<br>
  It takes <b>some</b> effort for me to do exercise.<br>
  Do we have <b>enough</b> rice to last the week?`
          },
          ` 5. Numbers: Numbers are either cardinal (one, two, three, etc.), which are adjectives referring to quantity, or ordinal (first, second, third, etc.) referring to distribution.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: <b>Two</b> cars are enough for most families.<br>
  There are about <b>twenty-five</b> people in my office.<br>
  It's my <b>fortieth</b> birthday next week.<br>
  That is the <b>second</b> time you've done that!`
          },
          `6. Distributives: Distributive determiners are used to refer to a group or individual members of the group. They reveal more about how people or things are distributed, shared, or divided.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: <b>Both</b> countries need to discuss the issues and find a solution.<br>
  <b>All</b> pet dogs need plenty of attention.<br>
  <b>Half</b> the people decided not to vote.<br>
  <b>Neither</b> house is suitable for our needs.<br>
  We can eat at <b>either</b> 7 pm or 8 pm.`
          },
          `7. Interrogatives: Interrogatives are used to ask questions. 'Which' as a determiner is used to ask about a specific group of people or things. 'What' as a determiner is used when we are asking a general question. 'Whose' is used to ask a question about possession.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: <b>Which</b> restaurant did you like best?<br>
  <b>What</b> time will you come?<br>
  <b>Whose</b> pencil is this?`
          },
          `# Rules
  The grammar rules for determiners are:
  1. They always come before a noun.
  2. They come before any modifiers used before the noun.
  3. They are required before a singular noun.
  4. They are optional before plural nouns.`

  `# Determiner
  A word that determines or limits a noun or a noun phrase is a determiner. Determiners can be divided into two broad categories: specific and general.
  Specific determiners are used in noun phrases to talk about or indicate specific people or things.`,
  {
  type: 'html',
  text: `Examples: <b>the</b>, <b>this</b>, <b>that</b>, <b>these</b>, <b>those</b>, <b>my</b>, <b>our</b>, <b>your</b>, <b>his</b>, <b>her</b>, <b>its</b>, <b>their<b>`
  },
  `We cannot use more than one specific determiner before a noun.
  General determiners are used to talk about people or things in a general or indefinite way.`,

  1. central determiners (the articles and other words such as my, this, and some that also function as pronouns)
  2. predeterminers (all, both, twice, such)
  3. post determiners ( many, few, several).
  Determiners include the following:
  1. articles: Definite (The), Indefinite (A and An), Zero Article
  2. possessive adjectives (my, our, your, his, her, their)
  3. demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those)
  4. distributives (each, every, either, neither)
  5. quantifiers (a few, a little, much, more, some, etc.) and numbers (one, two, forty, second, twenty-fourth, etc.)
  6. interrogative adjectives (what, whose, which)`
