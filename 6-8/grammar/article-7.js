I'll take <b>these</b> pills for my backache later.`

          `3. Possessive Adjectives: Possessive adjective determiners function as adjectives rather than pronouns. As they are adjectives, they appear before the noun that they are modifying.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>Examples</b>: Do you like <b>my</b> new dress?<br>

It takes <b>some</b> effort for me to do exercise.<br>
Do we have <b>enough</b> rice to last the week?`
          },
          ` 5. Numbers: Numbers are either cardinal (one, two, three, etc.), which are adjectives referring to quantity, or ordinal (first, second, third, etc.) referring to distribution.`,

That is the <b>second</b> time you've done that!`
          },
          `6. Distributives: Distributive determiners are used to refer to a group or individual members of the group. They reveal more about how people or things are distributed, shared, or divided.`,
          {
            type: 'html',

<b>Neither</b> house is suitable for our needs.<br>
We can eat at <b>either</b> 7 pm or 8 pm.`
          },
          `7. Interrogatives: Interrogatives are used to ask questions. 'Which' as a determiner is used to ask about a specific group of people or things. 'What' as a determiner is used when we are asking a general question. 'Whose' is used to ask a question about possession.`,

<b>What</b> time will you come?<br>
<b>Whose</b> pencil is this?`

          `# Rules
The grammar rules for determiners are:
1. They always come before a noun.
2. They come before any modifiers (e.g. adjectives) used before the noun.
3. They are required before a singular noun.
4. They are optional before plural nouns.`

`# Determiner
A word that determines or limits a noun or a noun phrase is a determiner. Determiners can be divided into two broad categories: specific and general.
Specific determiners are used in noun phrases to talk about or indicate specific people or things.`,
{
type: 'html',
text: `Examples: <b>the</b>, <b>this</b>, <b>that</b>, <b>these</b>, <b>those</b>, <b>my</b>, <b>our</b>, <b>your</b>, <b>his</b>, <b>her</b>, <b>its</b>, <b>their<b>`
},
`We cannot use more than one specific determiner before a noun.
General determiners are used to talk about people or things in a general or indefinite way.`,
{
type: 'html',
text: `Examples: <b>a</b>, <b>an</b>, <b>one</b>, <b>every</b>, <b>many</b>, <b>more</b>, <b>most</b>, <b>much</b>, <b>little</b>, <b>few</b>, <b>either</b>, <b>neither</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>other</b>, <b>each</b>, <b>some</b>, <b>both</b>, <b>any</b>, <b>enough</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>another</b>, <b>several</b>`
},
`Determiners are divided into three main groups: 
1. central determiners (the articles and other words such as my, this, and some that also function as pronouns)
2. predeterminers (all, both, twice, such)
3. post determiners ( many, few, several).
Determiners include the following:
1. articles: Definite (The), Indefinite (A and An), Zero Article
2. possessive adjectives (my, our, your, his, her, their)
3. demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those)
4. distributives (each, every, either, neither)
5. quantifiers (a few, a little, much, more, some, etc.) and numbers (one, two, forty, second, twenty-fourth, etc.)
6. interrogative adjectives (what, whose, which)`
