          `Mother Teresa is one of the world's most revered public figures of the entire 20th century, whose missionary work relieved the suffering of the sick, the poor, and the disadvantaged. Dubbed a 'Living Saint' during her lifetime, she founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, and dedicated her life to the pursuit of selflessness and compassion. Even today, her name is still famously associated with acts of care and devotion. We celebrate the life of this remarkable woman who had a marked impact on the lives of many, and who inspired future generations of humanitarians to come, with a series of her most famous achievements. 
Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia in 1910. Her parents were of Albanian descent. During her childhood, her own mother would invite poor people from the surrounding neighborhoods to eat supper with them. She told her daughter, “All of them are our people.” Mother Teresa followed in her mother's footsteps, taking the same open, compassionate attitude towards everyone.
While working in India, the Bengal province was struck by a terrible famine, leading to widespread illness, starvation and homelessness, particularly amongst women. In response, Mother Teresa established an open-air school and a home for dying people.
Mother Teresa went on to found the Missionaries of Charity, a religious organization made up of former teachers and students from the charity school where she had previously worked. Word spread quickly about their selfless work, and donations soon came in from all across India, giving them the much needed finances to make a real difference to people's lives.
Throughout the 1960s she set up charity houses dedicated to different groups in need all across India, including orphanages, hospices and lepers houses. During the 1970s Mother Teresa was able to take her humanitarian work further afield, spreading across the world. The types of groups her charity supported also expanded to unwed mothers and HIV/AIDS sufferers, as well as children from Christian and Muslim communities in Beirut.`

          `Marie Curie (Maria Salomea Skłodowska), Polish-born French physicist, famous for her work on radioactivity and twice a winner of the Nobel Prize. With Henri Becquerel and her husband, Pierre Curie, she was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics. She was the sole winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she is the only woman to win the award in two different fields.
Her early researches, together with her husband, were often performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a livelihood. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant researches and analyses which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of Marie's birth, and radium. Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.
Curie throughout her life actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, assisted by her daughter, Iréne, she personally devoted herself to this remedial work. She retained her enthusiasm for science throughout her life and did much to establish a radioactivity laboratory in her native city - in 1929 President Hoover of the United States presented her with a gift of $50,000 donated by American friends of science, to purchase radium for use in the laboratory in Warsaw.
The importance of Curie's work is reflected in the numerous awards bestowed on her. She received many honorary science, medicine and law degrees and honorary memberships of learned societies throughout the world. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. She also received, jointly with her husband, the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and, in 1921, President Harding of the United States, on behalf of the women of America, presented her with one gram of radium in recognition of her service to science.
Curie died in Savoy, France, after a short illness, on July 4, 1934.`

          `India's greatest female batter, Mithali Raj, has reached milestones aplenty in her storied international career spanning more than two decades. The woman with most runs in the game, and the only Indian captain to have led the side to two 50-over World Cup finals, the only major distinction that eludes the incumbent ODI captain is the tag of a World Cup winner. In pursuit of that dream, Raj bowed out of T20Is in September 2019, as India's highest run-scorer, having last led the side in the format during the 2016 T20 World Cup at home.
At 16, Raj scored an unbeaten 114 on ODI debut and soon established herself as the lynchpin of India's batting. The roots of her copybook stroke play lay in her precocious talent that blossomed under the tutelage of her former coach, the late Sampath Kumar, and a regimented upbringing in an army family. With a passion for Bharatanatyam, her nifty footwork found expression on the field, becoming as much a hallmark of her batting as have been grace and an unrivalled precision at plundering runs in the cover region.
Her technical soundness and ability to anchor an innings at the top of the order in all three formats have inspired two generations of India batsmen. Both those skills underpinned her highest Test score of 214, in 2002, and later an unbeaten 91 in the 2005 ODI World Cup semi-final, a knock she rates at par with her double-century.
During the 2017 ODI World Cup, Raj surpassed former England captain Charlotte Edwards to become the highest run-scorer in ODIs and the first woman to 6000 runs in the format. Her 409-run tally in the tournament was second only to England opener Tammy Beaumont's, while her three fifties and a century were vital to India's runners-up finish.
In the 2018 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, Raj found herself embroiled in a controversy in the wake of her omission from the semi-final. She accused then head coach Ramesh Powar of unfair and discriminatory behaviour and expressed her disappointment over T20I captain Harmanpreet Kaur's decision to support her exclusion.
In October 2019, Raj, at 36, became the first woman to complete two decades in ODI cricket. `

          `A girl born to change the vision of a country towards women, born to bring change in the world with her starry imagination, Kalpana Chawla is a true name that stands to be on the list of great personalities of all times. She was born in 1962 in Haryana and since the beginning of her school life, the universe fascinated her the most.
She was an ordinary girl with towering dreams and indomitable courage that made her the first Indian woman and the second Indian person to fly in space in 1997. As she recalls in an interview before the Columbia mission, how she and her brother used to hop on their bicycles to see where the aeroplanes were headed to.
From choosing her name 'Kalpana' which means 'imagination' to drawing colourful aeroplanes, her creativity led her to embark on an explorative journey which gave a reason for many young minds to pursue their dreams.
Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia accident on February 1, 2003, when the ship exploded upon re-entering the atmosphere. Chawla received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously, and various streets, colleges, and other organisations carry her name. In India, she is remembered as a national hero.`

          `Muthulakshmi Reddy was a freedom fighter. As a student of Madras Medical College from 1907-1912, she came into contact with Annie Besant.  Later she met  Gandhiji. She worked hard for the upliftment of women in India. Her immense contribution spans the political, medical as well as educational spheres. Muthulakshmi Reddy, the first woman legislator, was appointed to the Chennai Legislative Council in 1927. This nomination marked the beginning of her life-long effort to remove social abuses.
Muthulakshmi had many firsts to her recognition. She was the first girl student to be admitted into a Men's College, the first woman House Surgeon in the Government Maternity and Ophthalmic Hospital, the first woman legislator in British India, the first Chairperson of the State Social Welfare Advisory Board, and the first woman Deputy President of the Legislative Council and the first Alderwoman of the Madras Corporation. Muthulakshmi Reddy continued to fight for her cause till the end of her days. Even at the age of 80, she was energetic and vibrant. Her human preoccupations took her away from politics and she stuck to her mission and Gandhian ways.
Muthulakshmi Reddy was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the President of India in 1956. Her two outstanding monumental gifts for humanity remain the Avvai Home (for children) and the Cancer Institute.`
