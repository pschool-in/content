<b>Raj</b>: That's a great idea! I'm sure she'll be thrilled. How should we go about planning it?<br>
<b>Priya</b>: Well, first, we need to decide on a theme. What do you think Sarah would love? Maybe a beach-themed party or a masquerade ball?<br>
<b>Raj</b>: I think Sarah would enjoy a beach-themed party. It's summertime, and she loves the ocean. We can decorate the venue with beach balls, palm trees, and colorful leis. It'll create a fun and vibrant atmosphere.<br>
<b>Priya</b>: Perfect! Now, we should make a guest list and send out invitations. We should keep it a secret from Sarah, so maybe we can ask her close friends and family for help in gathering everyone's contact information.<br>
<b>Raj</b>: Good idea. We'll have to make sure everyone keeps it hush-hush. Let's also plan some exciting activities like a limbo contest, beach volleyball, and a photo booth with props.<br>
<b>Priya</b>: Absolutely! And let's not forget about the food. We could have a barbecue with burgers, hotdogs, and refreshing tropical drinks. And of course, a birthday cake!<br>
<b>Raj</b>: I'm getting excited just thinking about it! We should also arrange for a surprise entrance when Sarah arrives, maybe with a group of people holding up a "Happy Birthday" banner.<br>
<b>Priya</b>: That's a fantastic idea! We can assign someone to bring her to the party location blindfolded. It will add to the element of surprise.<br>
<b>Raj</b>: This is going to be the best birthday party ever. Let's start planning right away and make sure it's a day Sarah will never forget!<br>
<b>Priya</b>: Agreed! Let's get to work and make this a birthday celebration that will leave her speechless. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she realizes what we've done.`

<b>Victim</b>: Good evening, Officer Johnson. Yes, I was walking home when a man approached me from behind and forcefully grabbed my purse. I tried to hold on, but he overpowered me and ran away with it. I'm shaken up and scared.<br>
<b>Police Officer</b>: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you provide a description of the suspect?<br>
<b>Victim</b>: Yes, he was tall, approximately six feet, with short brown hair. He was wearing a dark hoodie and jeans. I couldn't see his face clearly, but he had a deep voice.<br>
<b>Police Officer</b>: Thank you for the details. Did anyone witness the incident? Were there any surveillance cameras in the area?<br>
<b>Victim</b>: I didn't see anyone around at the time, but there might have been some cameras near the intersection. I can show you the exact location where it happened.<br>
<b>Police Officer</b>: That would be helpful. We'll check the surveillance footage to see if we can identify the suspect. Did you notice if he had any distinguishing features, tattoos, or scars?<br>
<b>Victim</b>: I didn't see anything like that, unfortunately. He was wearing gloves, so I couldn't see his hands either.<br>
<b>Police Officer</b>: Understandable. We'll do our best to investigate this case. Please provide your contact information, and we'll stay in touch with any updates. Additionally, I recommend contacting your bank and canceling any cards that were in your purse.<br>
