        text: `Ramayya was a simple man living in the town. He lived with his wife in a nice house made of tiled roofs. He was not rich but he could take care of his family.
Two sparrows built a nest in a nice spot in the roof of Ramayya's house and the mother bird laid her eggs in it.
"My dear," began the male sparrow.
"And what do you want now?" asked his wife.
"Why does the lady of this house always quarrel with her husband?"
"How am I to know?" said the female bird. "Let us mind our own business."
"You are always self-centred," said the male sparrow and added, "Should we not help this poor Ramayya?"
The female sparrow said with disdain, "Let me see what help you can do for him. Please do not talk about what does not concern us. See that the cat does not come near our nest. That would be enough for you and me."
Somewhere in the muck-heap lay a diamond nose-jewel. The male bird picked it up and came to the nest with the shining stud in his beak and said to his wife: "Look! Do you like this?
The wife bird replied, "What am I to do with diamond nose studs or with ear-rings? Find some grub; the young ones are hungry."
The bird dropped the diamond stud on the floor and went out in search of little worms for the young ones.
Ramayya's wife noticed the jewel as she was sweeping the floor. She picked it up with delight and wore it.
Ramayya questioned her angrily, "How did you get this diamond-stud?"
"I found it lying here yesterday and took it. That is all."
"We should go and handover it to the village magistrate. If tomorrow the police should come and search our house, it will be disgrace to us."
In Meenakshi Ammal's house nearby, the talk went thus: "I forgot and left it in the bathroom. Kuppayi, the servant woman must have swept it out. She is very careless and ignorant."
The mother, Meenakshi Ammal, consoled her little girl saying, "Let us search and find it. Don't tell Father yet. He would go into a rage if he knew that you had lost the diamond nose-stud."
"What is the secret you are whispering?" asked Ramanatham.
The loss of the jewel had to be admitted. Soon the whole village knew about it. The maid-servant Kuppayi was suspected by everyone to have stolen it.
The police came and searched her hut, but could find nothing.
Ramayya's heart was in a flutter. Ramayya's wife put the stud away in her box. She soon developed a severe fever and was confined to her bed. No one thought of searching their house.
The he-sparrow said, "Look at the fun, my dear, the lady of this house is scared and is down with fever."
"Nice fun indeed!" said the she-sparrow. "The poor woman is in a panic. The fever may be the end of her."
"And a good thing too," said the cruel male sparrow.
"It is all your doing you brought and threw it here and tempted her," said the female bird.
The male bird answered gravely, "Did I tell her to steal the thing? This is bound to happen when human are being greedy."
"Rightly said, we should never be greedy for what belongs to others". "Come, let us go now and bring some worms for the young ones." And the two flew out.
Ramayya and his wife spend the rest of life in fear of being caught. The diamond nose-jewel may still be with them, but the fear of getting caught was even more.`

        text: `Once there was a boy named Mani. He was studying at the school in his village. He found it difficult to read and write. His grandfather noticed it and helped him by reading bedtime stories. Gradually, he started reading on his own. Now, he not only enjoyed reading but also has started writing his own stories. Let us read an essay written by Mani.
Hobbies are the activities that we do in our spare time. Hobbies are unique to people. Some like gardening, a few like photography, many have book reading as their hobby. While other hobbies are swimming, collecting stamps, playing video games, and many more.
People have hobbies not only to pass their free time but also to do something useful. Hobbies help people learn new things, relax after a day of tiring work and to energise their body and mind. Same is the case with me. I love writing, so it is my hobby.
"Whatever you like to do, make it a hobby." - Warren Buffet
Writing is a unique hobby because most people don't want to exhaust themselves in their spare time. Many feel that writing is tough, but I do not think so. I feel writing is like painting our voice. When I get free time, I pick a pen and a notebook and start painting my ideas in words. I write stories, poems and sometimes, about my feelings. My mind relaxes when I pour my thoughts as words. So, writing energises me.
When I write things, my imagination is at its best. I imagine a world with magic and magicians, where I can fly, and birds can talk. Writing helps me completely immerse myself into that world! Sometimes, I sit with small children and entertain them with these stories of mine. The happiness of their faces makes me to write more and better.
Although writing is just a hobby for me, yet it is very beneficial. It opens my mind to think beyond the little things with a broader mind. It makes me more passionate about my life. It makes me learn new things and enjoy every moment of my life.
"Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words." - Mark Twain
My hobby helped me in school too. When I started writing things, I was unable to describe them accurately. With time, my experiences helped me think of new ideas and this made me a good writer.
Now, I look out for things, which I was not able to see before. Hence, I can describe things better in my stories. I feel no problem with writing English essays or stories as it is my hobby. To become a better writer, I spend time on learning how to write in different forms like fiction and non-fiction. It is important to always learn and improve our hobbies. Who knows? One day I could be a writer like R.K. Narayan!`

        text: `Ajay Kumar Garg, is a very talented young artist. He lives in Jaipur, India. His childhood was going on well, until he suffered an injury at the age of three. Ajay was treated, but that treatment left him permanently deaf. His parents tried several hospitals to cure his impairment, but it didn't cure him. His father, once bought him a paint set to play. Ajay started to paint happily. He painted on the walls, floors etc. He looked happy, while using the paint set that was gifted to him. Soon, Ajay's father realised that Ajay was talented in painting. When Ajay was five years old, a court artist of Dholpur (Rajasthan), Shri Sua Lal saw his painting and was very impressed with his work. He then took Ajay and started training him.
After completing his education, Ajay tried tailoring but, that didn't make him happy so he went back to painting. He became an apprentice of Asha Devi. She taught Ajay the old and dying technique of 'Traditional Indian Miniature Painting'. He mastered the technique of preparing colors and brushes and gained knowledge of the paintings. Soon he became an accomplished artist in the miniature style. He uses a magnifying glass and a single-haired brush for miniature paintings that depict Indian culture. Ajay is gifted in the practice of creating images on a grain of rice.
Ajay exhibited his work and sold 144 out of the 150 paintings displayed. He continued to show his work throughout India, the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2004, Ajay was awarded a national award of accomplishment from the Indian President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
Apart from painting, Ajay is also very actively involved in the welfare of people with hearing impairment in India and has been the executive member of the 'Deaf & Dumb Association' in Rajasthan. He also gives free training to hearing impaired children in Jaipur as well as children in an orphanage in Gandhi Nagar, Jaipur. One of Ajay's current goals is to revitalise the dying art of traditional miniature Indian paintings.
Ajay's life shows us that we can turn our hobby or passion into a successful career, if we are ready to learn and develop our skills.`

        text: `The hard working and the passionate people, always chase their dream and live it. Ilavazhagi is one among the many to achieve her dream amidst all odds. Mr. A. Irudayaraj, her father, was a district level champion in carrom. His dream shattered, since his family did not encourage and support him. He was determined to achieve his dream through his daughter. He used to put his daughter on the carrom board, while she listened to the sounds of striker and coins. When she was two years old, he would carry her with him to the tournaments; he played with his friends at local clubs. Her father began coaching her when she was around five. One day her father called her for a match, and she won that match, which gave her confidence. The confidence led her to win. Her victories included the Asia Cup, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Cup and the world championship.
Irudhayaraj, a fish-cart driver who transports materials like pipes to make a living for his family – a wife and three daughters. They lived in a small one-room apartment in Vyasarpadi, Chennai, is not enough to accommodate the family. The trophies, she has won over the years are too many, and her home is just not big enough to keep them. The trophies left over after filling the space under the bed, were given to the neighbours and relatives. Financing the trips has always been a big trouble, though she has been playing for the state for almost 14 years. Still she says "Victories follow me".
Ilavazhagi is a member of the Thiruvallur District Carrom Association and also represented India at the Carrom World Championships and Asian Championships.
Achievements:
1. 5th World Carrom Champion, 2008 in France.
2. Women's singles title at the 38th Senior National Carrom Championships in Visakhapatnam, 2009.
3. Women's singles title in the 37th National Carrom Championship in Chennai, 2008.
4. 13th SAARC Carrom Championship women's doubles with Rashmi Kumari in 2009.
5. The two time SAARC Carrom Championship women's singles title in 2009.
6. World Cup winner in 2006 and the next was the 2010 championship in the US where she secured the first place in singles and doubles.
She holds 260 medals, out of which 106 are gold, 17 are silver & 12 are bronze medals won in national competitions. She has won 111 gold, 9 silver and 5 bronze medals in international tournaments.
Her hobby of playing carrom took her to the level of world champion.`
