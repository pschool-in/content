        text: `How wonderful and beautiful was the morning of Eid! The trees looked greener, the field more festive, the sky had a lovely pink glow. The sun seemed brighter and more dazzling than before to wish the world a very happy Eid.
The village was filled with excitement. Everyone was up early to go to the Eidgah. The boys were more excited than the others. They had been talking about it all the time. Finally the day had come. And now they were impatient. They were taking their treasure out of their pockets, counting and recounting it before putting it back. Mahmood counted "One, two, ten, twelve"– he had twelve coins. Mohsin had "One, two, three, eight, nine, fifteen" coins. With this money, they would buy countless things: toys, sweets, paper-pipes, rubber balls – and much more.
The happiest of the boys was Hamid. He was only four, thin and poorly dressed. Last year his father had died of cholera. Then his mother also died. From then Hamid lived with his old Granny Ameena and was as happy as a lark. She told him that his father had gone to earn money. And that his mother had gone to Allah to get lovely gifts for him. This made Hamid very happy. Hamid had no shoes on his feet; the cap on his head was soiled and tattered; He knew that his father would come back with sacks full of silver and his mother with gifts from Allah. Then he would have more than Mahmood, Mohsin, Noorey and Sammi.
Hamid's Granny Ameena was sad. It was Eid and she did not have even a handful of grains. If only her son were there, it would have been a different kind of Eid! Hamid went to his grandmother and said, "Granny, I will be the first to get back. Don't worry!" Ameena was worried. Other boys were going out with their fathers. How could she let him go to the fair all by himself?
Hamid left with the other boys. Hamid was like one with wings on his feet. They ran on ahead of the elders and waited for them under a tree. They reached the suburbs of the town. On both sides of the road were big houses of the rich. In the gardens, mango and leechee trees were full of fruits. Then they came across the stores of the sweets - vendors. All decorated so gaily! Every store had sweets piled up in heaps like mountains.`

        text: `Soon the roads began to get crowded. Some people were on tongas and ekkas, some in motorcars, all wearing perfume; all bursting with excitement. The children were  a calm and contented lot. For village children everything in the town was wonderful. Whatever caught their eye, they stood and gaped at it with wonder. At last, the Eidgah came into view. There were row upon row of worshippers as far as the eye could see. Newcomers lined themselves behind the ones already there.
The prayer was over. Men embraced each other. They descended on the sweet and toy-vendors' stores like an army moving to attack. There was the merry-go-round with wooden elephants, horses and camels! You paid one paisa and had twenty-five rounds of fun. Mahmood and Mohsin and Noorey and other boys mounted the horses and camels.
Hamid watched them from a distance. All he had were three paisas. He couldn't part with a third of his treasure for a few miserable rounds! They were soon done with their rides. Then it was time for the toys. There was a row of stalls on one side with all kinds of toys; soldiers and milkmaids, kings and ministers, water-carriers and washer- women and holy men.
Mahmood bought a policeman in khaki with a red turban on his head and a gun on his shoulder. Mohsin bought a water-carrier while Noorey got a lawyer. Those toys cost two paisa each. Hamid had only three paisas. How could he buy such expensive toys? If they dropped out of his hand, they would be smashed to bits. If a drop of water fell on them, the colour would run. But he looked at them hungrily and wished he could hold them in his hands for just a moment or two. After the toys it was sweets. Someone bought sesame seed candy, others gulab-jamuns or halva. They smacked their lips with relish. Only Hamid was left out.`

        text: `Next to the sweet-shops there were a few hardware stores and jewellery shops. The boys were not interested in anything there. So they walked ahead except Hamid.
It occurred to Hamid that his granny did not have a pair of tongs. Each time she cooked chappatis, the iron pan burnt her hands. If he bought her a pair of tongs she would be very pleased. She would never again burn her fingers. It would be a really useful thing to have in the house. So Hamid stopped to look at a pile of tongs at the hardware shop and asked the shopkeeper, "How much for this pair of tongs?" The shopkeeper looked at him and replied "It's not for you."
"Is it for sale or not?"
"Why should it not be for sale?
"It will cost you six paisa"
Hamid's heart sank. "Tell me the correct price," he said.
"All right, it will be five paisa, take it or leave it."
Hamid said, "Will you give it to me for three?" Then he walked away, afraid that the shopkeeper would scream at him. But the shopkeeper did not scream. On the contrary, he called Hamid back and gave him the pair of tongs. Hamid carried it on his shoulder as if it were a gun to show it to his friends. Mohsin laughed and said, "Are you crazy? What will you do with the tongs?" Hamid flung the tongs on the ground and replied, "Try and throw your water carrier on the ground. It will break."
Mahmood said "Are these tongs some kind of toy?"
"Why not?" replied Hamid. "Place them across your shoulders and it is a gun; carry them in your hands and it is like the musical instrument carried by singing monks. My tongs are like a tiger among toys."
Sammi who had bought a small tambourine asked "Will you exchange them for my tambourine? It is worth eight paisas." But Hamid would not. The pair of tongs won every one over to its side. By eleven the village was again filled with excitement. All those who had gone to the fair were back at home. Hamid too returned home. As soon as she heard his voice, Granny Ameena ran out of the house, picked him up and kissed him.
Suddenly she noticed the tongs in his hand. "Where did you find these tongs?"
"I bought them."
"How much did you pay for them?"
"Three paisas."
"You are a stupid child! It is almost noon and you haven't had anything to eat or drink. Couldn't you find anything better in the fair than this pair of iron tongs?"
Hamid replied in an injured tone, "You burn your fingers on the iron pan so I bought them." Granny was deeply moved by Hamid's selflessness. She started crying. For the wretched woman, the pair of tongs was as precious as sacks of silver.`

        text: `Dr. Watson visits the apartment of his friend Sherlock Holmes. He finds detective Holmes talking to a client with bright red hair, Mr. Jabez Wilson. Holmes asks Dr. Watson to hear the unusual story of the client.
Wilson says that he runs a pawnshop. One day in his shop, his assistant, Vincent Spaulding, showed an advertisement in the newspaper that announced an opening in the Red-Headed League. The announcement promised a salary of four pounds a week. Spaulding urged Wilson to apply. The timid red - haired pawnbroker did so. Wilson was accepted into the League by Mr. Duncan Ross, the head of the League.
He learned that the nominal duties consisted only of his coming to the office from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. each day and copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica in longhand. This he did for eight weeks until one day he arrived at the office to find it closed, with a notice on the door that the Red-Headed League had been dissolved. He was so disturbed by the thought that someone had been playing a practical joke on him that he came to Holmes for a solution. Holmes promises to look into the case and Wilson leaves. Holmes and Dr. Watson move to Wilson,s shop in Saxe-Coburg Square at once.
SCENE-1
Spaulding : Can I help you?
Holmes : Yes. How can I get to the Strand?
Spaulding : Third on the right, and fourth on the left. (He goes back into the shop and closes the door.)
Holmes : He's a clever young man, Watson.
Watson : Is he? Why did you ask about the Strand? You know London very well! You wanted to see him.
Holmes : Did you notice his trousers?
Watson : His trousers? No. But I saw you hit the ground with your stick?
Holmes : My dear Watson, this is not the time for discussion. I must go and look at the road behind Saxe-Coburg Square. You had to go to work.
Watson : Yes, to the hospital.
Holmes : Right, but I want your help tonight. Come at ten o'clock.`
