        text: `How wonderful and beautiful was the morning of Eid! The trees looked greener, the field more festive, the sky had a lovely pink glow. The sun seemed brighter and more dazzling than before to wish the world a very happy Eid.
          The village was filled with excitement. Everyone was up early to go to the Eidgah. The boys were more excited than the others. They had been talking about it all the time. Finally the day had come. And now they were impatient. They were taking their treasure out of their pockets, counting and recounting it before putting it back. Mahmood counted "One, two, ten, twelve"– he had twelve coins. Mohsin had "One, two, three, eight, nine, fifteen" coins. With this money, they would buy countless things: toys, sweets, paper-pipes, rubber balls – and much more.
          The happiest of the boys was Hamid. He was only four, thin and poorly dressed. Last year his father had died of cholera. Then his mother also died. From then Hamid lived with his old Granny Ameena and was as happy as a lark. She told him that his father had gone to earn money. And that his mother had gone to Allah to get lovely gifts for him. This made Hamid very happy. Hamid had no shoes on his feet; the cap on his head was soiled and tattered; He knew that his father would come back with sacks full of silver and his mother with gifts from Allah. Then he would have more than Mahmood, Mohsin, Noorey and Sammi.
          Hamid's Granny Ameena was sad. It was Eid and she did not have even a handful of grains. If only her son were there, it would have been a different kind of Eid! Hamid went to his grandmother and said, "Granny, I will be the first to get back. Don't worry!" Ameena was worried. Other boys were going out with their fathers. How could she let him go to the fair all by himself?
          Hamid left with the other boys. Hamid was like one with wings on his feet. They ran on ahead of the elders and waited for them under a tree. They reached the suburbs of the town. On both sides of the road were big houses of the rich. In the gardens, mango and leechee trees were full of fruits. Then they came across the stores of the sweets - vendors. All decorated so gaily! Every store had sweets piled up in heaps like mountains.`

        text: `Soon the roads began to get crowded. Some people were on tongas and ekkas, some in motorcars, all wearing perfume; all bursting with excitement. The children were  a calm and contented lot. For village children everything in the town was wonderful. Whatever caught their eye, they stood and gaped at it with wonder. At last, the Eidgah came into view. There were row upon row of worshippers as far as the eye could see. Newcomers lined themselves behind the ones already there.
          The prayer was over. Men embraced each other. They descended on the sweet and toy-vendors' stores like an army moving to attack. There was the merry-go-round with wooden elephants, horses and camels! You paid one paisa and had twenty-five rounds of fun. Mahmood and Mohsin and Noorey and other boys mounted the horses and camels.
          Hamid watched them from a distance. All he had were three paisas. He couldn't part with a third of his treasure for a few miserable rounds! They were soon done with their rides. Then it was time for the toys. There was a row of stalls on one side with all kinds of toys; soldiers and milkmaids, kings and ministers, water-carriers and washer- women and holy men.
          Mahmood bought a policeman in khaki with a red turban on his head and a gun on his shoulder. Mohsin bought a water-carrier while Noorey got a lawyer. Those toys cost two paisa each. Hamid had only three paisas. How could he buy such expensive toys? If they dropped out of his hand, they would be smashed to bits. If a drop of water fell on them, the colour would run. But he looked at them hungrily and wished he could hold them in his hands for just a moment or two. After the toys it was sweets. Someone bought sesame seed candy, others gulab-jamuns or halva. They smacked their lips with relish. Only Hamid was left out.`
