          `Born in a small village named Mvezo in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was originally named Rolihlahla Mandela. He grew up listening to the stories of the valour of his ancestors during the wars of resistance.
In the early 1940s, he chose to study law at the University of Witwatersrand where he got to know people from all races and backgrounds. During these years, he went on to join the African National Congress (ANC) in which a group of young Africans aimed to start a mass grassroots movement to voice the concerns of rural peasants and working people. ANC accepted his effective ways of petitioning like boycotts, strikes, non-cooperation and civil disobedience. What ensued ahead is a long journey of defiance against the oppressive South African regime and its apartheid policies.
Mandela spent almost 27 years in prison. He was arrested and detained continuously and emerged as a potent symbol of black resistance. He was released in 1990, and in 1993, Mandela received a Nobel Peace Prize for dismantling apartheid in South Africa. In 1994, he was elected as the first black President of South Africa in the country's first-ever democratic elections.`

          `Renowned for the liberation of slaves in the United States, Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1849. He was raised in Kentucky where he pursued a meagre education as he had to consistently juggle between jobs to provide for his family.
He was a self-taught lawyer and legislator, who went on to become one of the American heroes and great personalities of the American Civil War. He was appointed as the 16th US President shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln adopted an unconventional approach as a war leader in which he preferred to react to arising problems and circumstances rather than originating new policies and laying out designs.
Taking an experimental approach, he blended statecraft with the direction of armies. He utilised his practical insight and common sense to bring triumph to the country as a brilliant military strategist and savvy leader. It was not just his military genius that set him apart, but his gradual plan to bring freedom to the slaves through his tactical Emancipation Proclamation which paved the way for the abolishment of slavery in America.`

          `There is no one in India who is revered as much as Mahatma Gandhi. Some call him Mahatma, 'Great Soul' and to some, he is known as Bapu. Mahatma Gandhi was the leader who emancipated India from the shackles of British colonialism that was inflicted on the Indian masses for over 200 years. A globally-renowned figure, Mahatma Gandhi is known for his non-violent, highly intellectual, and reformist ideologies. Considered among the great personalities, the stature of Gandhi in the Indian society is unmatched as he is regarded as the 'Father of Nation' for his painstaking efforts at leading the freedom struggle of India.
Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Mahatma Gandhi's real name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Right from an early age, Gandhi was neither brilliant in class nor any better on the playing ground. No one at that time would have guessed that the boy would unite millions in the country and enlighten millions more around the world. The education of Mahatma Gandhi has played a significant role in making him one of the greatest people in the world.
Mahatma Gandhi had realized that education is the most powerful tool that can reshape society and Indian society needed it much. Gandhi's idea of education was mainly focused on character building, moral values, ethics and free learning. He was among the first to advocate that education should be made free to all and accessible to everyone irrespective of class. Gandhi encouraged craft-centred education in which he encouraged schools to include handicrafts as the compulsory subject in the curriculum. His vision at improving the educational standard of the country by incorporating craft in the syllabus at schools was also to encourage self-sufficiency in the students. He wanted education to become inclusive and lead to the overall development of the students, moreover, he stressed on the need for promoting mother-tongue through education. 
Gandhi was certainly a notable figure in Indian history and instrumental in abolishing the social evils prevalent in the community. He was the first to raise his voice against segregation and apartheid. His ideologies were widely accepted at the global level which still continues to influence people to help to make the world a better place. Patron of various movements and reforms, Gandhi's is an uncontestable figure in India's struggle for freedom.`

Nehru played a crucial role in shaping India's destiny as an independent nation. He advocated for a secular and socialist India that would prioritize social justice, economic development, and equality. Nehru's vision for India was enshrined in the country's constitution, which he helped draft as the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
As India's first Prime Minister from 1947 to 1964, Nehru focused on nation-building and steering India towards modernization. He championed industrialization, agrarian reforms, and the establishment of a mixed economy. Nehru also emphasized the importance of education and launched initiatives to promote scientific research and technological advancements.
Nehru's leadership during challenging times, including the Partition of India and the subsequent violence, earned him the respect and admiration of millions. He played a key role in advocating for non-alignment during the Cold War, positioning India as a leader of the newly independent nations in the post-colonial era.
Beyond his political contributions, Nehru was known for his eloquence, intellectualism, and commitment to democratic principles. His speeches and writings continue to inspire generations of Indians and his philosophy of secularism and inclusivity remains a guiding principle in Indian governance.
Jawaharlal Nehru's legacy as a statesman and a visionary leader is deeply intertwined with the history of modern India. His efforts in shaping the nation's identity, fostering unity amidst diversity, and promoting social and economic progress have left an indelible mark on the country's history.`

The disease gradually paralyzed his body, leaving him confined to a wheelchair and reliant on a computerized speech synthesizer to communicate.
Despite his physical limitations, Hawking's intellect and determination knew no bounds. He made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of black holes, the nature of time, and the origins of the universe. His most famous work, "A Brief History of Time," brought complex scientific concepts to a wider audience, becoming a bestseller and solidifying his status as a scientific icon.
Throughout his life, Hawking demonstrated immense courage and resilience in the face of adversity. He once said, "However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at." Despite the challenges posed by his condition, he continued to work tirelessly, inspiring countless individuals with his unwavering pursuit of knowledge.
Hawking's remarkable achievements were recognized globally, earning him numerous accolades, including the prestigious Albert Einstein Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and being made a Fellow of the Royal Society. His work and indomitable spirit continue to inspire scientists, students, and individuals from all walks of life, showing that the power of the human mind can triumph over any obstacle.`

          `Born on August 6, 1881, in Lochfield, Ayrshire, Scotland, Alexander Fleming was a renowned Scottish biologist and pharmacologist. He grew up in a rural area and developed a deep curiosity for the natural world from an early age.
Fleming's interest in medicine led him to study at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in London and later at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School. During his medical career, he witnessed the devastating impact of infectious diseases and became determined to find a solution.
In 1928, while working at St. Mary's Hospital, Fleming made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized medicine. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of his petri dishes, and to his surprise, the mold inhibited the growth of bacteria surrounding it. This accidental observation led to the development of the first antibiotic, penicillin, which became a vital weapon in fighting bacterial infections.
Fleming's discovery of penicillin laid the foundation for the field of antibiotics and transformed the practice of medicine. His work significantly improved the survival rates of patients with previously untreatable infections and saved countless lives.
Throughout his career, Fleming continued to research and advocate for the responsible use of antibiotics. He emphasized the importance of proper dosage and warned about the potential dangers of antibiotic resistance, which are challenges still faced in modern medicine.
Alexander Fleming's contributions to science were widely recognized and honored. In 1945, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and medical professionals worldwide, reminding them of the power of accidental discoveries and the impact they can have on society.`

To support his family, he started selling candies and vegetables on trains. Later he became a telegraph operator and spent a handful of years in this profession. At 19 he moved to Kentucky to work at the Associate Press Beuro and requested the night shift, this would give him plenty of time to read and experiment.
Due to an incident that occurred at the press house, because of his experiment, he was fired. This is when he decided to open his research laboratory.

          `Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, was a legendary professional boxer and one of the most influential figures in sports history. He first gained fame as an amateur boxer, winning a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.
Ali's career in professional boxing was marked by his unmatched skills, agility, and confidence inside the ring. He quickly rose through the ranks and became the world heavyweight champion in 1964, defeating Sonny Liston in a stunning upset. Known for his lightning-fast footwork, powerful punches, and charismatic personality, Ali captivated audiences worldwide.
Beyond his boxing prowess, Ali was also a prominent civil rights activist and a vocal critic of racial injustice. Inspired by figures like Malcolm X, Ali embraced the Nation of Islam and changed his name, rejecting his "slave name" and adopting the Muslim name Muhammad Ali. He used his platform as a celebrated athlete to speak out against racism and social inequality, becoming an influential figure in the civil rights movement.
In 1967, Ali took a controversial stand against the Vietnam War by refusing to be drafted into the military. He cited his religious beliefs and opposition to the war as reasons for his refusal, famously saying, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong." This decision led to his boxing license being suspended, his heavyweight title being stripped away, and him being banned from the sport for three years during the prime of his career.
Ali's conviction was eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971, and he made a triumphant comeback to boxing. He went on to have several iconic fights, including the "Rumble in the Jungle" against George Foreman in 1974 and the "Thrilla in Manila" against Joe Frazier in 1975. These fights solidified his status as one of the greatest boxers of all time.
Muhammad Ali's impact extended far beyond the boxing ring. He used his fame and influence to promote humanitarian causes, such as advocating for racial equality, religious freedom, and world peace. His magnetic personality, witty quotes, and unyielding spirit made him a global icon and a symbol of courage, resilience, and the triumph of the human spirit.
Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, but his legacy as a boxing legend, social activist, and cultural icon continues to inspire people around the world. His words and actions remind us that true courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to rise above it and fight for what is right.`
