          `Born in a small village named Mvezo in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was originally named Rolihlahla Mandela. He grew up listening to the stories of the valour of his ancestors during the wars of resistance.
            In the early 1940s, he chose to study law at the University of Witwatersrand where he got to know people from all races and backgrounds. During these years, he went on to join the African National Congress (ANC) in which a group of young Africans aimed to start a mass grassroots movement to voice the concerns of rural peasants and working people. ANC accepted his effective ways of petitioning like boycotts, strikes, non-cooperation and civil disobedience. What ensued ahead is a long journey of defiance against the oppressive South African regime and its apartheid policies.
            Mandela spent almost 27 years in prison. He was arrested and detained continuously and emerged as a potent symbol of black resistance. He was released in 1990, and in 1993, Mandela received a Nobel Peace Prize for dismantling apartheid in South Africa. In 1994, he was elected as the first black President of South Africa in the country's first-ever democratic elections.`

          `Renowned for the liberation of slaves in the United States, Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1849. He was raised in Kentucky where he pursued a meagre education as he had to consistently juggle between jobs to provide for his family.
            He was a self-taught lawyer and legislator, who went on to become one of the American heroes and great personalities of the American Civil War. He was appointed as the 16th US President shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln adopted an unconventional approach as a war leader in which he preferred to react to arising problems and circumstances rather than originating new policies and laying out designs.
            Taking an experimental approach, he blended statecraft with the direction of armies. He utilised his practical insight and common sense to bring triumph to the country as a brilliant military strategist and savvy leader. It was not just his military genius that set him apart, but his gradual plan to bring freedom to the slaves through his tactical Emancipation Proclamation which paved the way for the abolishment of slavery in America.`

          `The world's most famous equation E=mc^2, the theory of relativity, which helped to complete theories that had been put forth by Newton and the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect which is an important step in the development of quantum theory. A German-born theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein is the man behind these innumerable findings.
            As a fact, do you know that Einstein took a diploma from Federal Polytechnic School and was later awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich? He started his career working in a patent office but later shifted to the research & development domain completely. The famous scientist greatly contributed his knowledge to students in various educational institutes like the University of Bern, Humboldt University of Berlin, Caltech, University of Oxford, etc.
            Awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921, Albert Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. With his great personality and contribution, many leading scientists and physicists are trying to complete Einstein's ultimate dream of a "theory of everything."`

          `Known as the most creative inventor of all time, Thomas Alva Edison spent most of his life bringing new inventions to people's lives by feeding his ideas with a correct approach. Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio and spent his early childhood days in Michigan. His family was canal owners and with time, the business declined.
            To support his family, he started selling candies and vegetables on trains. Later he became a telegraph operator and spent a handful of years in this profession. At 19 he moved to Kentucky to work at the Associate Press Beuro and requested the night shift, this would give him plenty of time to read and experiment.
            Due to an incident that occurred at the press house, because of his experiment, he was fired. This is when he decided to open his research laboratory. His most famous inventions were Photograph, Motion Picture Camera and the life-changing â€“ Light Bulb. Edison is also regarded as the very first inventor who promoted teamwork while processing an invention with researchers and employees.`

          `A girl born to change the vision of a country towards women, born to bring change in the world with her starry imagination, Kalpana Chawla is a true name that stands to be on the list of great personalities of all times. She was born in 1962 in Haryana and since the beginning of her school life, the universe fascinated her the most.
            She was an ordinary girl with towering dreams and indomitable courage that made her the first Indian woman and the second Indian person to fly in space in 1997. As she recalls in an interview before the Columbia mission, how she and her brother used to hop on their bicycles to see where the aeroplanes were headed to.
            From choosing her name 'Kalpana' which means 'imagination' to drawing colourful aeroplanes, her creativity led her to embark on an explorative journey which gave a reason for many young minds to pursue their dreams.
            Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia accident on February 1, 2003, when the ship exploded upon re-entering the atmosphere. Chawla received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously, and various streets, colleges, and other organisations carry her name. In India, she is remembered as a national hero.`

          `"Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." The personality of Satyajit Ray cannot be better explained than the words about him by Akira Kurosawa, one of the most influential filmmakers. Revered among the best storytellers of the 20th century, Satyajit Ray has left an indelible legacy in film direction which continues to inspire the modern industry.
            Born in Bengal in 1921, Satyajit is counted among the very few filmmakers having mastery over several fields. A Screenwriter, Music Composer, Graphic Artist, Lyricist, and Author, Ray has an unmatched reputation as a polymath in modern cinema. Regarded as among the greatest film directors of all time, he has several awards to his credit including the prestigious National Film Award, BAFTA, and Ramon Magsaysay award.
            Having produced several films, the critically lauded ones include Pathar Panchali, Charulata, Music Room, and The Big City. The cynosure of Indian cinema, Satyajit's genius is incontestable making among great personalities. His dedication motivates many to pursue Film Studies, Film Editing, and Acting Courses. `
