        text: `We can see many things around us. Everything we can see and touch is made up of matter. Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter.
# What is Mass?
Mass is a measure of how much matter is present in an object. The air we breathe, the food we take, and the water we drink, all have matter in them. 
# What is Volume?
The space occupied by an object is called its volume.
# Three States of Matter
Solid, liquid and gas are the three states of matter. 
Solid has a fixed shape and fixed volume. eg: pencil, bat, bag, apple, stone, book.
Liquid does not have a fixed shape. It takes the shape of its container. eg: milk, honey, water, juice, oil, petrol.
Gas does not have a fixed shape and volume. eg: cloud, smoke, gas cylinder (LPG), spray, water vapor, wind.`

        text: `Matters change their state as the temperature changes. Solid changes to liquid and liquid changes into gas on heating. Gas becomes liquid and liquid becomes solid on cooling.
# Melting
The change of solid into liquid on heating is called melting. For example, if ice (solid) is heated, it will change into water (liquid).
# Evaporation
The change of a liquid into vapor on heating is called Evaporation. For example, if water is heated, it will change into steam.
# Freezing
The change of liquid into solid on cooling is known as freezing. For example, water (liquid) poured into in ice-tray and placed in the freezer (fridge), gets cooled and becomes ice (solid).
# Condensation
The change of gas into liquid on cooling is called condensation. For example; clouds (gas) on cooling condense and fall as rain (liquid)
# Experiment
Take a balance. Keep an air-filled football on one plate and an empty football on another plate. What happens? 
Air filled ball goes down. It is because air has mass.`
