Elephants were used to travel across thick forests and were trained to carry loads and people.
Then man invented the wheel. No vehicle on the road can move without the wheel. Man used the wheel to make carts. He used animals like horses, bullocks and donkeys to pull carts with loads and to travel.
He made chariots and bicycles using the wheel. Then came all the vehicles that we see today - cars, buses, trains and auto rickshaws.
There are four modes of transport.
1. Roadways (Eg: car, bus, van) 
2. Railways
3. Waterways (Eg: ship, boat)
4. Airways (Eg: aeroplane, helicopter)`

Sailing boats use sails to move. The sails can be adjusted based on the wind direction. They are used for travel and sport.
