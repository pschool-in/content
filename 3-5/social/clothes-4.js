1. To cover our body.
2. To protect ourselves from dust and dirt.
3. To feel warm during winters.
4. To avoid tanning from the sun.
5. To look presentable.
# How do we know what to wear?
We usually have three main seasons: summer, winter and the rainy season. These seasons last for almost 4 months and after the completion of one cycle, they continue to follow each other. That's why it's called 'cycle of seasons'. So, we can say that what we wear depends on the cycle of seasons.
In addition to this, we wear clothes of different designs, colors and tradition. So we can say that clothing style also depends on occupation, taste and occasion.
# Do you know?
Uniforms of soldiers are called 'camouflage' because it matches with their environment so that the enemies could not spot them easily.`
