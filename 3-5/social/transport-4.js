        text: `Transportation is the action of moving people or things from one place to another.
Before the invention of wheels, humans used to walk everywhere. Ancient India, used bullock carts to cover distances. Even today, many use bicycles to travel to work and schools. Bicycles are a popular and environment friendly mode of transportation in India.
# Modes of Transportation
There are different modes of transportation in India.
# Roadways
India has been building roads since old times. India's road network is the second longest in the world. Bus forms the most important means of public road transport system in India. Buses are usually often managed by the respective state governments.
1. National Highways:  These are the main roads connecting cities in the country. e.g. N.H. 44 runs from Srinagar to Kanyakumari.
2. State Highways: These are the road connecting important cities within the State.
3. District roads: These roads connect markets and offices in the district to people.
4. Village Roads: These roads connect villages or a group of villages with each other and also to other major roads near it.
# Railways
In India, railway is the most important form of transport system connecting various states. The first railway line was laid between Mumbai and Thane in 1853. Steam engines were used at the time. From steam engines to high speed rail, the growth of Indian Railways over the past 150 years has been vast and it has contributed to development of India.
The fastest train in India is the Gatimaan Express that runs between Delhi and Agra.
There are also sub-urban rails that connects different places within a city.
Indian Railways is the largest railway network to be operated by a single government and it is the 4th largest network in the world. Darjeeling Himalayan Rail in West Bengal is a World Heritage Site and it is the only steam operated railway in India.
# Water transport 
India has a very long coastline and hence ports remain main centers for trade.
Shipping Corporation of India, a government owned company manages all offshore and other marine transport related infrastructure in the country.
Water transport happens through:
1. Boat
2. Speed Boat
3. Ship
The boats are widely used for fishing in coastal regions.
# Air Transport
Air transport is the fastest way to travel to different parts of the world.
Air India, a government airlines plays a huge role in connecting India to other cities within the country and across the world.
Helicopters are used for hilly regions like Haridwar, Badrinath, Kedarnath and Darjeeling.
India has the world's highest helipad at the Siachen glacier which is 21,000 feet above sea level.
# Advantages of transportation
1. Transport system plays a huge role in the growth of agricultural and industrial production by carrying raw materials to different parts of the country.
2. It helps in promoting foreign trade in a country. Transportation plays a key role in a country's export and import of goods.
3. It helps people from different countries visit other countries. Without a good transport system, promotion of tourism is not possible.`

The invention of the wheel is an important step in the progress of mankind`

        text: `Vehicles that run on fuel, constantly emit smoke and some poisonous gases. These gases mainly include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Similarly, minute particles of carbon and lead are also released into the air. An excess of these substances lowers the quality of air in the environment. This is what we call air pollution.
Air pollution affects animals and plants in the following ways :
1. Trachea, lung and eye disorders, e.g. burning of the eyes.
2. The leaves of plants shrivel up and fall.
3. Sprouts get scorched. The growth and development of plants is affected adversely.
4. Constant traffic through forest areas can harm the habitat of plants and animals living there. The wild animals in these forests begin to migrate elsewhere.
5. The constant sounds of vehicles create noise on a large scale. It causes ill effects such as restlessness, irritability, headaches, lack of concentration,  psychological disorders, etc.
6. If there are traffic jams, air and noise pollution in that area increases.
7. Traffic accidents cause injuries, deaths and damage to the vehicles.
We should cultivate habits such as walking short distances or riding a bicycle for slightly longer distances. In this way, we can avoid the use of fuel-burning vehicles and reduce pollution. At other times, using public or private transport can save time and effort.
In this way, we can reduce the severity of the harmful effects of transportation. The following are some more remedies for reducing pollution.
1. Using fuels that cause less pollution. Eg: LPG, CNG
2. Timely maintenance and repair of vehicles.
3. Using public transport as far as possible.
4. Using private vehicles only when necessary
5. Planting trees, especially indigenous or local varieties like banyan, peepul, neem, etc. and caring for them.These trees adapt easily to the local environment and help in enhancing biodiversity.
In these modern times, we use cars, ships and aeroplanes that run on fuel. In the olden days, ships did not use such engines. They had sails which helped to use the force of the wind. They were called sailing ships. In those days, people travelled all over the world on these ships.`
