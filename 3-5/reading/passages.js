        text: `Just as a dash of pure light that strikes through the sky, thoughts on purity occupied my mind. The white color on our flag reminds me once again about the purity that must rule our thoughts, our land, the world and the entire universe. To recollect - Do we breathe in pure air every day? - Do we drink pure water every day? - Do we leave our dear ones pure space to live? The word 'pure' now has a meaning that has grown enormous and it leaves every nook and corner of the human mind with too many questions.  
Purity in thoughts, deeds, words, dialogues, workplace, living space, footsteps, and pathways. Purity has become a demanding need of the hour. Everywhere we go we are encountered with something impure. Love for a sophisticated and materialistic life has left us impure. Though we don't do the things we wanted to do, the result glares at us - with our deeds we have triggered nature's alarm bell. It is time to wake up with broadened shoulders and thoughts to embrace and welcome purity everywhere. Let us not leave behind something impure to make us live pure.`

        text: `Look at the familiar doll of three wise monkeys. What do they tell us? Don't speak unclean words, don't see unclean situations, don't hear unclean dialogues. Cleanliness is the need of the hour. Every one of us strives our level best to keep ourselves clean, to wear clean clothes, and to live in a clean space. Yet, knowingly or unknowingly we leave the space around us unclean. That is something 100% true.  
In today's context, the doll of three wise monkeys imparts more significance. The sophisticated lifestyle that we all enjoy prevents us from spending some seconds thinking about the future. For a secure future, we insure our lives.  Do we tend to insure and ensure a clean space for our future generation to live a healthy life? Sophisticated machines and technology may make our lives comfortable and happy. Yet, think about this - will they assure us and our children a healthy space with pure air to breathe, pure water to drink, and pure food to eat? Unlike loads of money to spend, let us take an oath to give our children a cleaner world to play, live and be happy.`

        text: `This week, when we went for our usual morning walk at the nearby beach, we were surprised to spot some dolphins. We felt happy to watch the friendly dolphins, which leaped four feet and turned around three times in the air. One of my friends, a marine biologist, told me that they are spinner dolphins. The mammals looked slender with long thin beaks and a distinct stripe connecting the long and pointed flippers to the eyes. 
Spinner dolphins are commonly found in the tropical and sub-tropical oceans. He also told me that only spinner dolphins can spin several times in the air. They frequently jump high out of the water and spin around like a spinning top. Some scientists believe that the spinning behavior is a way of communicating with the other spinners. It may also show alertness and communicate with the school where they are. This acrobatic jump may also help the spinner dolphins to free their food that can be attached to other large fish. 
According to resources, the morning time is the celebration time for the spinner dolphins as they play together. The spinners touch and rub each other and engage in playful games. They swim underneath one another and move their pectoral fins back and forth. Some spinners hold hands with their flippers and caress each other with their tail flukes. 
Spinner dolphins may differ in body size, shape, and color patterns. But, in general, they have common characteristics, namely, slender bodies, long and thin beaks, small flippers pointed at the tips, and appearing in dark gray, light gray, and white colors. Most of these spinner dolphins have white bellies. Spinner dolphins have 45 to 65 pointed teeth. The spinner dolphin feeds on small fishes and squids.`

        text: `The world will not be a beautiful place if it is without flowers. Flowers with their varied colors and perfume convey that life is beautiful. Flowers have the power to make a shabby place look like a place worth living in. A flower can bring cleanliness, beauty, and peace of mind to the place.
According to Wikipedia, a flower is a reproductive structure, found in plants. The four main parts of a flower are the calyx, corolla, stamen, and pistil. The parts of a flower are arranged in a circular pattern called a whorl.  The calyx is the outer whorl of sepals. The calyx is green in color, and in some plants, it looks like a petal. As a collective unit, the sepals form a calyx, and the petals form the Corolla. 
The Corolla is the inner whorl of petals. The petals are thin, soft, and colorful to attract insects for pollination. A whorl of stamens consists of a bunch of filaments. Each filament is topped by an anther, in which pollen grains are produced. The pollen contains the male gametes. The pistil is the female part of the flower. The pistil has the carpel, which is the female reproductive organ. The sticky tip of the pistil is called stigma and it receives the pollen grains. 
The floral structure of every plant is different from the others. The main parts of a flower are described by its position and not by its function. Surprisingly, all the flowers do not have all the four main parts of a flower. Sometimes, some parts are modified for some specific function. The floral formula is used by botanists to represent the structure of a flower. Specific letters, symbols, and numerals are used to describe the structure of a flower. 
Ca - calyx
Co - corolla
A - androecium
G - gynoecium
Many flowers are used as symbols with specific meanings. Red roses are considered symbols of love, beauty, and passion. Daisies are considered symbols of innocence. Lilies are considered symbols of resurrection and life. 
Jasmine is also considered a symbol of love. Orchids are symbols of perfection, and sunflowers are considered as a symbol of infatuation. In Hinduism, Lotus is considered a symbol of fertility, purity, and creation. `

        text: `Pranny ran to the school bus with a hop. Her friends greeted her with a loud cheer. One by one, they got into the bus. Luckily, Pranny got the window seat. Pranny always liked to sit by the window. She loved to count the number of trees that the bus crossed. Pranny started to count the number of trees when their bus entered the main road. Pranny had finished counting one hundred when they reached their picnic spot. Pranny and her friends jumped from the bus and entered the park with a scream that could bring down the buildings. Luckily, there were no buildings and the wide sky echoed back. Pranny's teacher asked them to form a line and walk in pairs. Holding the hand of the partner, everyone started to climb up the path on the hill. 
Once they reached the top of the hill, everyone started collecting different types of flowers and leaves as their specimens. After some time, Pranny found out that she had walked away from her friends. Not a bit worried, she started to collect her flowers. Suddenly, she heard the galloping sound of a horse. A wild pony came galloping towards her. Pranny wanted to move away from the horse. So, she started to run. But, instead of running away from the horse, Pranny started to run toward the horse.  The shocked pony stopped and looked at her. Then, with a wild cry, the pony turned away from Pranny and climbed down the hill, galloping in speed. It took a while for Pranny to come to her senses. Then, with a cool shake of her shoulders, she started to collect her flowers once again.`

        text: `The mother lizard slowly climbed the open shelf at the corner of the kitchen, searching for a place to lay her eggs. For the past two days, it hunted for a place where she could keep her eggs. The top corner of the shelf proved to be a safe place. Some bottles filled in the space and hid the corner of the shelf from the view. It would take at least six weeks for the eggs to hatch. Once baby lizards come out of the eggs, they can move freely in no time.
Six weeks later, more than six baby lizards hatched out of the eggs.  All the baby lizards followed their mother outside. The mother lizard led them to the nearby tree and started to teach them how to hunt small insects. The last one hatched, Tiny, did not want to move away from the hiding place on the shelf. The mother went looking for Tiny. The little lizard curled up at the corner of the shelf and refused to follow her.
‘I am not coming.’ Tiny replied to her mother. 
‘What are you going to do here? You will not get enough food here.’ 
‘It is so warm and cozy here. I don’t want to come out and freeze in the cold.’ Tiny replied sharply.
‘Freezing cold? Who told you so? Come out and see yourself.’ The mother lizard called Tiny once again. 
‘Is it not winter now?’ 
‘Yes, but it is not so cold. If it is cold, we can stay inside the garage. People will chase you away if they find you.’ But, Tiny was not in a position to listen to her mother. 
At that moment, Bob, the cat entered the kitchen. His sharp nostrils told the presence of the lizard. Without making a noise, he jumped onto the flat slab near the sink. Standing near the sink, he looked around searching for a way to reach the top of the shelf. Meanwhile, the mother lizard has moved halfway on the wall. Sensing danger, she wanted to move fast and escape out of the window. Looking at the cat, she moved her tail fast and let a part of the tail break away. The tiny piece of tail fell on the floor of the kitchen and it started to wriggle as if struggling for life. Bob jumped down and sat down looking at the wriggling tail. Tiny was silently watching all these things. Without making any more comments, she silently followed her mother and went out through the kitchen window.`

        text: `The cool rays of the moon peeped in through the gap between the thin strips of coconut leaves. Standing on the terrace, Mini stood staring at the moving clouds in the sky. The clouds were sailing through the sky gracefully. Gazing continuously at the full moon made her feel calm at heart and it also helped her nerves to settle down with a rhythm. Suddenly a ray of light started to descend from the sky. It slowly dispersed and touched the top of a coconut tree. The coconut leaves slowly moved in the evening breeze and sent the light in every direction. The pale-colored light rays slowly deepened to illuminating green light. It started to come towards Mini.
The dazzling brightness of the light made her eyes blink for a while. The bright light touched her feet. Something moved in the green light and reached her. As if walking through a long corridor, a small doll-like figure walked out of the green light. In the darkness, she could not figure out what it looked like.
Mini stooped down to see clearly what the little figure looked like. The first thing that Mini noticed was the strong smell that came from it. The aroma roused and spread all around her. Mini felt to be standing inside a circle of hypnotic power. Her skin started to breathe out tiny drops of sweat and her palms became wet with sweat. She wanted to open her mouth and speak to the little alien-like creature. Her tongue struggled hard to move. 
Millie, the alien, looked at Mini. The eyes without any eyebrows looked at her. It sent a vibration throughout her body. A strange feeling went down Mini's spine. While Mini struggled with such a sensation, a chilled spray of water splashed at her face and dribbled down her chin. Mini suddenly came to her senses. The overflowing water from the water tank has helped her to come out of the trance and break the magic spell from the alien. Within seconds the green light started to ascend toward the sky and disappeared from her sight. Mini slowly tried to recollect what happened to her. But, she could not do so. Her memory cells were wiped clean and she kept staring at the wide blue sky.`

        text: `‘Joe, come and have your breakfast.’ Mary called her nine-year-old son.
As usual, he is late for school. Running down the stairs, he reached the table. Throwing bread crumbs all around, he finished his morning breakfast.
‘Sit down and drink your juice’, his mother scolded. Every morning is a struggle with him. Until he gets onto the school bus, the whole place looks like a fighting pit.
Sitting on the chair, Joe started sipping the fresh juice. Near the left corner of the table, a little ant, Neemoo, was passing. Attracted by the bread crumbs that Joe spilled, it moved near to pick up a large piece. Some bits of crumbs stood on the polished shoes of Joe. Neemoo wanted to carry that crumb home. It slowly climbed on his left shoe. When it reached the top of the left shoe, Joe finished drinking the juice.
‘Ma, bye-bye!’ Joe started to walk toward the door. Neemoo was shocked by the sudden jerk and held tightly to the threads of the socks. The bread crumbs fell on the floor, but Neemoo could not climb down the shoe. Breathless, it stayed at the top of the shoe.
When Joe climbed onto the bus, Neemoo lost his grip and fell on the last step of the bus. The door of the bus closed and started moving toward the school. Neemoo stretched his feelers to know where he was. Neemoo heard the shrilling screams of little boys and girls. Neemoo moved here and there on the last step of the bus. After walking around a few circles, Neemoo decided to rest at the corner of the step. Neemoo lived in the corner of the dining room at Joe’s house. He has never gone out of the dining room. Even if he went out to the window sill, some ants always came along. This is the first time Neemoo is away from home and traveling on the bus.
After the children went to school, someone started to clean the bus. Neemoo did not know what to do. He moved into the corner of the step and stayed there without moving a leg.`
