The full stop is on the bottom row. Find the ring finger on your right hand.
Commas get you thinking, believing. Reach to the left of the full stop. Good.
Stretch your longest finger. When beginning new lines, hit the Enter key once.
Find and hold the Right Shift key for these left hand capitals.
Be careful. Try to keep your fingers curved. Very nice.
Do not let your wrists rest on the desk. That is not good use of energy.
Which brings us close, very, very close, to the end of this beginner lesson.
Do not type for too long without stretching your shoulders, neck, wrists, fingers.
Keep your legs Uncrossed while doing these drills. It is good ergonomics.
Keep both of your feet firmly on the vinyl floor. Get your body in mint condition.
It helps if you remember which finger is for which key. Every one counts.
Otherwise you might finish with clumsy, unnecessary errors.
Look before you cross the street or you might get knocked down.
