# Images

The images what we have are temporary. We will create better images when we have a full-time graphic designer.

The size of the image should be within the square of side 160 pixel. (In case if the width is much larger than the height - then the image appear smaller)

We try to keep the image with white background. The image format is jpg. (We avoid png due to large file size)

We use small images to avoid copyright issues and ease of creation. In future, we support bigger images, so that they come nicely on tablet and desktop. We prefer to use svg images wherever possible.

All images are put in the same folder. This ensure there is no repitation and also easy for programming.

All images are grouped and displayed under the route '/author/images'. The configuration is present in 'config/allImages' file. The image incharges are free to edit and regroup the images.

Keep our 'golden rule 2' in mind. Don't delete anything.

## Image Creation

We usually get the images through google search. And then edit them using tools.

Using Gimp,
- crop the image and remove unnecessary portions and aspect-ratio
- resize the image so that it falls in the square frame of side 160 pixel.
- publish as jpg

Using Krita,
- Republish with 60% quality. (Usually it reduces the filesize to 25%)

# Videos

We prepare simple videos for promotion and tutorial purpose.

We use vokoscreen to record a portion of a desktop screen.

We use kdenlive (or any other video editor) to edit the video.
