# App Version and cache issue

Every release will be identified with a version number. It can be found at the bottom of the FAQ page.

While testing new release, please ensure that you are testing on the latest version.

Our app is Progressive Web App (PWA). For fast loading of the app, the files will be saved and retrieved locally. Due to this the latest files will not be available immediately.

To get the lastest version, first open the url and check the version. If the version is 'old', then please wait for 1 min. In this time the new version will be downloaded in the background. Then close all browser windows. Now open the app in the new url and check the version. You will get the latest content.
