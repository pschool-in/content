 Reading-Notes
 Introduction:
 The living world comprises of plants and animals. 
 Plants can prepare food by themselves, grow in size, and reproduce. 
 Various parts of the plants are used as food, medicine, wood, and shelter.
 Our body is made up of many organs.
Similarly the plant body is also made up of
several organs such as root, stem, leaves
and flowers. A flowering
plant consists of two main parts. They are,
1. Root system (below the ground)
2. Shoot system (above the ground)

Root System:
The part of the plant which lies underneath the soil is called the root system.
Root has no nodes and
internodes. It has a root cap at the tip. A tuft
of root hairs is found just above the root tip.
Roots are positively geotropic in nature 
Root system is classified into two types.
a. Taproot system
b. Fibrous root system
 Taproot system
It consists of a single root, called
taproot, which grows straight down into
the ground. Smaller roots, called lateral
roots arise from the taproot. They are
seen in dicotyledonous plants.
Example: Bean, Mango, Neem.
Fibrous root system
It consists of a cluster of roots arising
from the base of the stem. They are thin
and uniform in size. It is generally seen in
monocotyledonous plants.
Example: Grass, Paddy, Maize.
Functions of the Root
1. Fixes the plant to the soil.
2. Absorbs water and minerals from the
soil.
3. Some plants like carrot and beet root
store food in root.
Shoot system
The aerial part of the plant body above
the ground is known as the shoot system.
Main axis of the shoot system is called the
stem. The shoot system consists of stem,
leaves, flowers and fruits.
Stem
Stem grows above the soil, and it grows
towards the sunlight. It has nodes and
internodes. Nodes are the parts of stem,
where leaf arises. The part of the stem between
two successive nodes is called internode.
The bud at the tip of the stem is known as
apical or terminal bud, and the buds at the
axils of the leaves are called axillary buds.
Functions of the stem
1. Supports the branches, leaves, flowers
and fruits.
2. Transports water and minerals from roots
to upper aerial parts of the plant.
3. Transports the prepared food from leaves
to other parts through stem.
4. Stores food as in the case of sugarcane.
Leaf
The leaf is a green, flat expanded
structure borne on the stem at the node.
A leaf has a stalk called petiole.
The flat portion of the leaf is called leaf
lamina or leaf blade. On the lamina,
there is a main vein called midrib. Other
veins are branched out from mid rib. The
portion of the leaf connected in the nodal
region of the stem is known as the leaf
base. Leaves of some plants possess a
pair of lateral outgrowth on the base,
on either side of axillary bud. These are
called stipules.
The green colour of the leaf is due to
the presence of green coloured pigment
called chlorophyll. On the lower side of the
leaf there are tiny pores or openings known
as stomata.
Functions of the Leaves
1. The green leaves prepare food by
photosynthesis.
2. They help in respiration.
3. They carry out transpiration.
