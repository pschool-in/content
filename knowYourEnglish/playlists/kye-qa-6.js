          text: `What is the meaning of ‘dime a dozen’?
This is an expression that is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. When you say that something is ‘dime a dozen’, you mean it is very common; it is abundant, and therefore of very little value. In the US, a ‘dime’ is a ten-cent coin. If you can buy a dozen items for ten cents, then the things that you are buying are very cheap indeed. The expression became popular in the 1930s.
I can easily find someone to replace Vikram. Workers like him are dime a dozen.
In our country, crooked politicians are dime a dozen.
What is the meaning of ‘talisman’?
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of this word. The first vowel sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘can’, ‘fan’ and ‘ban’, and the following ‘lis’ rhymes with ‘fizz’, ‘biz’ and ‘Ms.’. The final ‘a’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘TA-liz-men’ with the stress on the first syllable. A talisman is your lucky charm; it is an object that you wear or keep because you believe that it has magical powers. It is something that will bring you good luck; keep you safe by warding off evil spirits. The object can be anything - ring, watch, stone, etc.
When I fell ill, my grandmother kept a talisman under the pillow.
I use this pen whenever I have an exam. It is my talisman.
How is the word ‘recalcitrant’ pronounced? 
The vowels in the first and third syllables are pronounced like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’. The ‘cal’ in the second syllable rhymes with ‘pal’, ‘shall’ and ‘gal’. The final ‘a’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘ri-KAL-sit-rent’ with the stress on the second syllable. ‘Re’ means ‘back’ and the Latin ‘calcitrare’ means ‘to kick’. The word literally means to ‘kick back’ or ‘kick with the heel’. Nowadays, ‘recalcitrant’ is mostly used to refer to a person who is difficult to handle or deal with. This individual does not like to be told to do things, and as a result, seldom obeys orders. He remains defiant. The word can be used with things as well.
It’s time that we started disciplining the recalcitrant students.
I don’t want on my team people who have the reputation of being recalcitrant.
What is the difference between ‘count on someone’ and ‘count in someone’?
The normal expression is ‘count someone in’ and not ‘count in someone’. When you count someone in, you include the person in a particular activity. The opposite is ‘count someone out’. When you ‘count on’ or ‘count upon’ someone, you are depending or relying on them for something. You expect them to be there for you.
Ganesh is counting on his father to lend him the money.
Please don’t let me down, Shekar. I’m counting on you.
If you’re going trekking, you can count Bala out. He won’t come.
Harish was looking for volunteers to help him clean the park. I told him to count me in.

          text: `What is the meaning of the expression ‘elephant in the living room’?
 An elephant is a relatively large animal; it will be impossible to miss, especially in the confines of a living room. You can pretend to ignore it, but you will always be aware of its presence. The expression ‘elephant in the (living) room’ is mostly used to refer to a serious problem — one which people are aware of, but choose to ignore. They think that if they do not talk about it, the problem will somehow go away. Another expression which has the same meaning is ‘gorilla in the room’.
Dowry — the elephant in the living room that neither party was keen on discussing.
Does the word ‘cellfish’ exist? 
Yes, it does; the word is a combination of ‘cell phone’ and ‘selfish’. When people get a call on their cell phone, they sometimes get so involved in their conversation that they forget their surroundings. We have seen drivers stop their vehicle in the middle of the road to answer the phone — ignoring the honking and swearing of their fellow drivers behind them. In our country, some people, as soon they board the train, take out their cell phone and proceed to talk loudly. These individuals are not really bothered if they are disturbing those around them. Using the cell phone in this manner, when you completely disregard the wishes and feelings of those around you, is described as ‘cellfish’.
I told the idiot in the opposite berth to stop being cellfish. Who wants to listen to his marital problems in the middle of the night?
How is the word ‘vide’ pronounced?
There are several ways of pronouncing this word of Latin origin. One way is to pronounce the first vowel like the ‘ee’ in ‘feel’, ‘peel’ and ‘heel’, and the following ‘de’ like the word ‘day’. The word can be pronounced ‘VEE-day’ with the stress on the first syllable. It is mostly used in formal contexts - especially in academic writing - to mean ‘look at’ or ‘refer to’. When an author uses this word, he means that he would like the reader to refer to a particular book, document or page for additional information. In India, formal letters referring to an earlier correspondence usually contain this word.
The comic genius has also played serious roles in films – vide The Truman Show.
Is it okay to say ‘I heart you’?
The expression seems to be used in the United States. We know that world over the shape of the heart is used as a symbol of love and affection.
It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that the Americans use the expression ‘I heart you’ to mean ‘I love you’; they believe that it is a better way of saying the same thing. ‘I heart you’ is used by people who are reluctant to use the word ‘love’ when they wish to declare their feelings to their partner.
According to some scholars, this expression became quite popular in 2012 when the R&B artist, Tony Braxton, released her single ‘I heart you’.

          text: `What is the meaning of ‘regift’? 
We often receive gifts on our birthday that we do not particularly like or care for. Sometimes, two people give us the same gift. What do we do with them? Some people throw these gifts into their cupboards and forget all about them. The smart ones gift them to their friends or members of their family on their birthdays. This act of passing on a gift that you have received to someone else is called ‘regifting’. The friend/family member does not realise that you are merely getting rid of a gift that you do not like. The American comedy show, ‘Seinfeld’, was instrumental in popularising this word. ‘Regift’ can be used both as a noun and a verb. A person who regifts frequently is called a ‘regifter’.
Harish was honest about it. He told me that the pen was a regift.
Anil is planning to regift the ugly painting he got from Mala.
What is the difference between ‘tiring’ and ‘tiresome’?
When you say that an activity that you performed was rather ‘tiring’, what you are suggesting is that it made you extremely tired. In other words, it was exhausting; the activity left you rather fatigued. When you say that making conversation with someone is rather ‘tiresome’, what you are suggesting is that you find it rather boring or annoying. The word has a negative connotation.
I’ve had a long, tiring day. So, let’s not go anywhere this evening.
Watching the same movie every day can become quite tiresome.
Filling out all these application forms is proving to be a tiresome process.
How is the word ‘broach’ pronounced?
The word rhymes with ‘coach’ and ‘poach’. When you ‘broach a subject’, you very hesitantly bring it up during a conversation or discussion. You are hesitant because you probably realise that it is a delicate matter; one that could either upset you or the person you are talking to. So, when you ‘broach’ something, you are introducing something new with a great deal of reluctance.
The student wanted to change her supervisor. But she didn’t know how to broach the subject with the Dean.
After dinner, Jaidev broached the subject of marriage with his daughter.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘at the helm’?
Drivers make use of the steering wheel to steer a vehicle in a particular direction. In the case of a boat or a ship, it is the ‘helm’ that functions as a steering wheel. The person who is ‘at the helm’ is referred to as the ‘helmsman’.
Since he determined in which direction the ship would go, the expression ‘at the helm’ began to be used to refer to a leader or someone who was in charge of something. Why ‘at the helm’ and not ‘at the steering wheel’? People were using boats and ships long before motorcars had been invented.
The company is doomed. The Board has decided that Sashi will be at the helm.
Prema has been requested to be at the helm till she retires in July.

    title: `Did you hear the cackle?`,
    text: `How is the word ‘abysmal’ pronounced?
The vowels in the first and last syllables are like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The ‘bys’ in the second syllable is pronounced like the word ‘biz’. The word is pronounced ‘e-BIZ-mel’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Greek ‘abusos’ meaning ‘bottomless pit’.
The word carries with it a negative connotation. When you say that someone’s performance was abysmal, you are suggesting that it was extremely bad; it was appalling. This is one of the meanings of the word.
Ashwin’s performance at the interview was abysmal.
The voter turnout for the elections was abysmal.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘shooting from the hip’?
For those of us who have grown up watching westerns (cowboy films), the expression brings to mind the duel between two gunfighters. The two men would stand at a certain distance from each other, and the aim was to ‘draw’ (remove the gun from the holster) and fire as quickly and accurately as possible. The quickest way to achieve this was to fire the gun from the hip - with the gun held low and to one’s side. The problem was, it was not possible to be accurate when shooting in this manner. Nowadays, the expression is used figuratively to mean to act impulsively. When you shoot from the hip, you say or do things without thinking things through. Like the gunfighter, whose aim is to fire the gun as quickly as possible, your aim is to respond immediately to something someone has said or done.
As your campaign manager, I strongly advise you to stick to the prepared script. Avoid your tendency to shoot from the hip.
The star became very flustered during the interview and began to shoot from the hip. 
What is the difference between ‘cackle’ and ‘laugh’?
The first syllable in ‘cackle’ rhymes with ‘pack’ and ‘back’. Of the two, ‘laugh’ is a general term and can be used in various contexts. There are different kinds of laughter; one can laugh loudly or softly. ‘Cackle’, on the other hand, suggests a particular type of laughter. When a person cackles, he laughs in a loud manner; people around can hear the laughter and some may involuntarily shudder for it sounds rather high pitched and harsh. In our films, it is usually the evil witch who has this kind of laughter.
When you describe someone’s laughter as being a ‘cackle’, you are showing disapproval.
As I climbed the stairs, I heard my grandmother and her friends cackling in the drawing room.
How can you marry someone who cackles like a witch?
Is it okay to say, ‘He is considering to play for another team’?
Although we hear such sentences quite frequently, careful users of the language would argue that the word ‘considering’ should not be followed by ‘to’. It should be followed by a gerund - the ‘ing’ form of a verb. You always consider doing something.
Devaki is seriously considering quitting her job.
The college is considering declaring tomorrow a holiday.
I have a very strict gun control policy. If there’s a gun around, I want to be in control of it. — Clint Eastwood`

    text: `What is the difference between ‘humongous’ and ‘huge’?
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘humongous’. The first syllable rhymes with ‘dew’, new’ and ‘few’, and the second with the words ‘sung’, ‘dung’ and ‘rung’. The ‘ous’ in the final syllable is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘hyu-MUNG-es’ with the stress on the second syllable. Unlike ‘huge’, the word is mostly limited to informal contexts. When you say that something is ‘humongous’, you are suggesting that the object is enormous. It suggests that it is bigger in size than ‘huge’. According to some scholars, the word is a combination of ‘huge’ and ‘monstrous’.
The Dilips live in a humongous house in Delhi.
My favourite star’s latest film is a humongous hit.
What is the meaning of ‘hit the road’?
The expression is frequently heard in American English in informal contexts. When you say that you are ready to hit the road, what you mean is that you are ready to begin your journey. In other words, you are ready to leave the place where you are now. The expression was originally used to refer to a road trip of some kind - by car, motorcycle, bus, etc. No one is really sure about the origin of the expression. Another expression which has the same meaning is ‘hit the trail’.
If we are to reach Bengaluru by 10 o’clock, we have to hit the road early.
I’ve been here too long. It’s time for me to hit the road again.
How is the word ‘magnanimous’ pronounced? 
The word consists of four syllables. The ‘a’ in the first and second sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘man’, ‘tan’ and ‘fan’, while the following ‘i’ is like the ‘i’ in ‘knit’, ‘chit’ and ‘fit’. The vowels in the final syllable sound like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘mag-NA-ni-mes’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘magnum’ meaning ‘great’ and ‘animus’ meaning ‘spirit, mind’. The word is normally used to refer to someone who is very generous and forgiving - he is willing to forgive his enemies/rivals and those less fortunate than him. He is gracious towards those he has defeated.
Trump was magnanimous in victory; he praised his rival, Hillary Clinton.
Show the world how magnanimous you can be. Don’t press charges against him.
What is the meaning of ‘none the worse for wear’? 
Some people when they have a bad experience are unable to forget about it. They are haunted by it for the rest of their life; it affects them adversely. In the case of some others, the bad experience has no impact on them. When you say that someone was none the worse for wear, what you mean is that the experience did not harm him in any way. The individual was not emotionally or physically scarred.
Ramesh returned my scooter after six weeks. It was none the worse for wear.
The PT master made the children practise in the hot sun. They were, however, none the worse for wear.

    text: `What does the expression ‘You’re toast’ mean?
The expression is mostly used in American English, and its use is limited to informal contexts. When you tell someone he is toast, you mean that he is in serious trouble; what he has done is likely to result in his ruin. The expression can also be used to mean ‘defeated’.
If the global markets continue to slide, our company is toast.
Kiran’s career was toast the moment his boss caught him kissing his daughter.
With 110 runs to get in four overs, India is toast.
How is the word ‘minion’ pronounced?
The first syllable rhymes with ‘win’, ‘pin’ and ‘fin’, and the second ‘i’ is like the ‘y’ in ‘yes’ and ‘yesterday’. The ‘o’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘MIN-yen’ with the stress on the first syllable. A minion is an underling; he is an insignificant person with little or no authority. He works for someone who is important and merely does as he is told. In movies, for example, the villain usually surrounds himself with minions. The word is used to show disapproval.
Rajiv sent one of his minions to hand over the package.
Sahana treats my friend Pankaj like her minion.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘on cloud nine’? 
When someone says that he is on ‘cloud nine’, what he means is that he is extremely happy about something. The person is in a state of absolute bliss. As far as he is concerned, everything is perfect; God is in His Heaven and all is right with the world.
My neighbour was on cloud nine when he heard that Trump had won.
Rima wasn’t just pleased when Ashwin proposed to her. She was on cloud nine.
Though there are many theories, no one is really sure about the origin of this rather strange expression. Some believe that meteorologists (weathermen) refer to the thunderstorm cloud as ‘cloud nine’ - and this cloud, in some instances, has been known to rise to a height of 70, 000 feet. So, if you are on one of these clouds and looking down, you have every reason to feel happy - unless of course, you are scared of heights!
Which is correct: ‘different from’ or ‘different than’? 
There was a time when experts on usage considered ‘different than’ to be wrong. But now you find native speakers of English using both. In terms of meaning, there is no difference between them. ‘Different than’ is much more common in American English. The British, on the other hand, prefer ‘different from’ and ‘different to’. The three can be used interchangeably in most contexts.
Biswajit says that his new boss is very different from/than his old one.
The way we celebrate our new year is very different from/to the way you celebrate yours.

    text: `What is the meaning of ‘Supreme Court reads the riot act to BCCI’? 
The expression ‘read the riot act’ is mostly used in British English to mean to reprimand someone; you speak angrily to a person about the wrong he has done, and warn him of consequences. Nowadays, the expression is mostly used to mean to criticise or scold a person quite severely. It is used to show disapproval. In the context of the sentence that you have given, it means that the Supreme Court gave BCCI a stern warning — and perhaps threatened its members of dire consequences if they did not carry out the necessary changes they had been asked to.
The teacher read the riot act to the three students who walked in late.
Mother read me the riot act when she caught me smoking.
In the early decades of the 18th century, the political situation in Britain was rather unstable — people were very angry and unhappy with King George I. To ensure that people did not take matters into their own hands and create chaos, the Riot Act was passed in Parliament in 1714. According to this Act, not more than a dozen people could assemble in public places. If more people came together, then the local law enforcement official ensured the crowd dispersed. He achieved this by reading aloud the Riot Act. If the people chose to ignore the warning, they were put in jail.
What is the difference between ‘frown’ and ‘scowl’? 
The ‘sc’ in ‘scowl’ sounds like the ‘sk’ in ‘skin’ and ‘skit’, while the following ‘owl’ is pronounced like the word ‘owl’. Both words can be used as a noun and a verb, and they both refer to the expression on someone’s face. When you ‘frown’ or ‘scowl’, you knit or bring your eyebrows together; this results in lines appearing on the forehead. The word ‘frown’ has several different meanings. One can frown because he disapproves of someone or something — you can frown at someone in anger. People also frown when they do not understand or are puzzled by something that someone has said. Very often, people frown when they are focussing or concentrating on the task at hand. ‘Scowl’ is mostly used to indicate one’s displeasure. The anger displayed or shown in this case is much more intense than a frown. According to experts on usage, “a scowl is a type of a frown, but not all frowns are scowls”.
Amit walked out of the room with a scowl on his face.
The students scowled at the Vice-Chancellor defiantly.
When she saw what I was wearing, Usha gave me a disapproving frown.
Very few people actually frown upon gossip.
Is it okay to say ‘With regards to your query...’?
No, it is not. According to standard dictionaries, it is always ‘with regard to’ and ‘in regard to’; not ‘regards to’. But the expression ‘with regards to’ is becoming common even among native speakers of English - especially, in informal contexts.
With regard to the matter raised at the last meeting, we are still looking into it.

    text: `What is the meaning and origin of ‘tip one’s hands’?
It is not ‘tip one’s hands’ but ‘tip one’s hand’. This idiom has been part of the English language for several hundred years, and it is mostly used in informal contexts to mean to reveal one’s secret. When you tip your hand, you unintentionally reveal what you are planning to do; you blurt out your secret.
Vijay is being extra cautious. He hasn’t tipped his hand about who he is going to vote for.
Let’s continue to keep the media guessing. Let’s not tip our hand.
The expression comes from the world of cards. When you play cards, you try to ensure that the other players do not see what cards you are holding. If you accidentally tip your hand, you let everyone know what you have — your secret is out.
Is it okay to say ‘He is having a cell phone?’
Although sentences like ‘I’m having a cell phone’, ‘I’m having a car’ and ‘I’m having two beautiful children’ are frequently heard in our country, native speakers of English would consider them to be unacceptable. The word ‘having’ is not usually used to indicate possession — you do not use ‘having’ to mean that you own something. You normally say ‘I have a car’ and not ‘I’m having a car’. You can, however, use ‘having’ when you are talking about a medical condition. For example, you can say, ‘I think he’s having a heart attack’.
She has a husband who supports her in everything she does.
How is the word ‘chauvinism’ pronounced?
The ‘chau’ is pronounced like the word ‘show’. The ‘i’ is pronounced like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘knit’, and the ‘s’ sounds like the ‘z’ in ‘zoo’, ‘zero’ and ‘zing’. The word is pronounced ‘SHOW-vi-ni-zem’ with the stress on the first syllable. Some people drop the vowel in the second and fourth syllables and pronounce the word ‘SHOV-ni-zm’. A chauvinist is someone who blindly believes that his country and the people in it are the best in the world. He will not be willing to listen to arguments or acknowledge facts that go against his belief; he will turn a blind eye to them. When you refer to man as being a chauvinist, what you are suggesting is that the individual very strongly believes that men are superior to women. The word has a negative connotation.
Why Vani married a male chauvinist pig like Hemant is beyond me.
Their chauvinism prevents them from seeing that their country is at fault.
Nicolas Chavin was an extremely patriotic soldier in Napoleon’s army.
What is the difference between ‘prophecy’ and ‘prophesy’? 
The first is a noun and the second is a verb. There are a few pairs like this in English: advice (noun), advise (verb); practice (noun), practise (verb); device (noun), devise (verb), etc. Prophecy means having the ability to predict what is likely to happen in the future.
He had prophesied that India would win the World Cup.
According to the prophecy, you will die a horrible death.

The first syllable sounds like the word ‘all’ and the third like the word ‘it’. The ‘be’ in the second is pronounced like the word ‘bee’. The word is pronounced ‘all-BEE-it’ with the stress on the second syllable. This rather formal word has the same meaning as ‘even though’ and ‘although’. In the early twentieth century, experts on usage believed that this old fashioned word would die a natural death, but it continues to be used fairly frequently in writing even today. Albeit, in Robert Burchfield’s opinion, is “one of the persistent archaic sounding words in the language.”
Rahul tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to give up eating sweets.
The teacher paid me a compliment, albeit grudgingly.
What is the meaning of ‘the devil is in the detail’?
The earlier expression was ‘God is in the detail’. Sometimes, we may fail to perform what appears to be a simple task because we have not paid sufficient attention to the minor details. The expression ‘the devil is in the detail(s)’ is frequently used to sound a note of caution to someone. You are telling or warning the individual that if he chooses to overlook the minor details, his attempt to do something will result in failure. The expression is also used to suggest that something that looks simple may not necessarily be so — the steps required to accomplish the task may be complicated.
Meera thought she could write the instructions in an hour. It took her all day. The devil was in the details.
It’s not as easy as it looks. The devil is in the detail.
What is the difference between ‘conceited’ and ‘proud’?
The word ‘conceited’ always has a negative connotation. A conceited person thinks very highly of himself and may refuse to mingle with those around him. When he does talk, it will always be about himself — his achievements, his hobbies, his abilities, etc. He tends to be an ‘I’ specialist! Unlike ‘conceited’, the word ‘proud’ can be used to show both approval and disapproval. It has both a positive and a negative meaning. A person who is pleased with his achievement can say that he is ‘proud’ of it. Unlike an individual who is conceited, a person can be proud of someone else’s achievements as well. ‘Proud’, like ‘conceited’, can also be used to refer to someone who thinks no end of himself. There is, however, a difference in degree. Some dictionaries define conceited as being ‘excessively proud’.
I refuse to team up with that conceited man.
Damini is a proud and arrogant woman.
I’m proud to win this championship for the sixth time.
What is the meaning of ‘all but’? 
The expression seems to have two different meanings. It can be used to mean ‘almost nearly/completely’ and ‘all except’. Here are a few examples.

We managed to rescue all but one of the miners.

    text: `What is the meaning and origin of the expression ‘happy as a clam’?
This is the shorter form of the expression ‘happy as a clam at high tide’. A clam is a sea creature that buries itself in the sand to escape predators. It has a shell that it uses to protect itself; when threatened, the two halves of the shell quickly snap shut. It is from this that we get the expression ‘to clam up’ to mean ‘to stop talking’ or ‘refuse to talk’. Some varieties of clams are found very close to the seashore, and the best time to dig for them is when the tide — water level — is low. A clam becomes vulnerable during low tide. When the tide is high, it feels less threatened, and therefore much happier. When you say that a person is as happy as a clam at high tide, you mean that he is extremely happy.
Jai was happy as a clam at high tide when he got the promotion.
Raj clams up whenever he is in the company of girls.
What is the difference between ‘purposely’ and ‘purposive’? 
In both cases, the stress is on the first syllable. When you do something ‘purposely’, you do it deliberately or intentionally. You make up your mind to do something, and you do it.
Many students purposely come late to class.
Hema purposely pushed Jai into the pool.
While ‘purposely’ is used in both formal and informal contexts, the use of ‘purposive’ is mostly limited to formal ones. It means ‘serving a purpose, useful’. Anything that serves a purpose can be said to be ‘purposive’.
Do you seriously believe that meditation is a purposive activity?
Is it okay to say, ‘Could you possibly help me with this?’
Yes, it is. In terms of meaning, there is no difference between ‘Could you help/possibly help me with this?’ In both cases, you are enquiring very politely if the individual would help you with something. The difference between the two is in the degree of politeness. Native speakers would suggest that the use of ‘possibly’ makes the request even more polite.
Could I (possibly) borrow your car this weekend?
Could you (possibly) give me a ride home?
What is the meaning of ‘droolworthy’?
When you ‘drool’, saliva flows out of your mouth. Babies drool quite a bit. Some adults drool when they are sleeping. The expression ‘drool over someone/something’ is frequently used in English to mean to take extreme delight or pleasure in looking at someone or something. The person that you are looking at is so gorgeous that you salivate/drool looking at him/her. It is from this that we get the relatively new word ‘droolworthy’. An object that is droolworthy is exciting to look at; just looking at it makes your mouth water.
The cakes that were on display were droolworthy.
Many of my friends find the new hero droolworthy.
