    text: `“I read about your new principal in the papers yesterday. What do you think of her?”
“I haven’t been well the past couple of days. So, I haven’t been to school. According to my friends, she is very friendly.”
“That’s good to know. The newspapers say that she’s a brainiac.”
“Brainiac? Does it mean someone who is very intelligent or something?”
“Very good. In informal contexts, someone who is very intelligent can be called ‘brainiac’. The word is a combination of ‘brain’ and ‘maniac’.”
“The brainiac next door is leaving for London this weekend.”
“If you need help solving the problems, ask the brainiac who sits next to you. He is really good at maths.”
“I seldom open my mouth when I’m in the company of my brainiac cousins.”
“Wise thing to do. Brainiac, by the way, is the name of a character in the Superman comics. He’s a super smart alien.”
“Really? You’re pulling my legs, aren’t you?”
“Why would I want to pull your leg? Do you even know what the expression means?”
“Of course, I do! It means to play a trick on someone. When you pull someone’s legs, you joke with them. Mayank and Sameer enjoy pulling each other’s legs.”
“And they seem to have a lot of fun doing it. By the way, it’s not ‘legs’, but ‘leg’. I enjoy pulling my sister’s leg once in a while.”
“Did Raju really win the lottery, or is he pulling my leg?”
“Why don’t you ask him? I’m sure he’ll tell you…”
“No way! I’m scared of him. He gets angry for no reason at all. And when he does, he can be quite nasty. The last time…”
“Yes, I remember. He threw several verbal punches at you.”
“He threw verbal punches at me? What are you talking about?”
“When you throw verbal punches at someone, you say things that are meant to hurt the feelings of the individual. You’re being very nasty.”
“So instead of punching someone physically, you’re using words to hurt him!”
“Exactly! During the weigh-in, the two boxers exchanged several verbal punches.”
“How about this example? What did you say to Rekha to make her so angry? Why was she throwing so many verbal punches at you?”
“That’s a good example. Sometimes, it’s the verbal punches that really hurt.”
“True. They hurt a lot more than the physical punches. Tell me, does ‘verbal punches’ have the same meaning as ‘altercation’?”
“No, it doesn’t. When you have an altercation with someone, you have an argument with him. In this case, both of you are doing the shouting.”
“I see. Sridhar had an altercation with his neighbour.”
“The young couple had an altercation on the train. The other passengers were amused.”
“So, in the case of an altercation, both parties are involved in the shouting. Whereas…”
“Both parties may not be throwing verbal punches at each other. It could be just one person.”
“But it could also be both?”
“That’s right! It could be both or just one.”
I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. — Woodrow Wilson`

text: `“According to this article, our coach was the sometime captain of the Ranji Trophy team. Is it okay to say ‘sometime’ captain? Shouldn’t it be ‘former’ captain?”
“The word ‘sometime’ is used as an adjective in formal contexts to mean ‘former’. Your ‘sometime captain’ is your former captain.”
“I see. How about this example? The CBI raided the sometime Minister’s house?”
“Sounds good. The sometime Secretary of the Club passed away last week.”
“Let’s not talk about death. Let’s talk about…”
“Your team beating last year’s champions. How did it feel when you held the trophy?”
“I’m not really sure. We won because we had a bit of luck. We didn’t play all that well.”
“The important thing is that you won. Your team struck a purple patch at the right time.”
“Purple patch? What are you talking about?”
“The expression is used in sports quite a bit. When you say that someone struck a purple patch, what you’re suggesting is that the individual had tremendous success.”
“There was a period of time when he played really well and won many events.”
“Exactly! He could do no wrong. The expression is used in informal contexts. Now that Djokovic has hit a purple patch, people expect him to achieve the Golden Slam.”
“The contender enjoyed a purple patch in the first two sets. After that, he faded away.”
“Wouldn’t it be nice to go through a purple patch every now and then. You need a bit of luck to actually…”
“Is there any other word that can be used with ‘luck’?”
“It’s possible to say ‘a stroke of luck’. For example, by a stroke of luck, Kumar’s flight was delayed. I got to spend some time with  him.”
“How about this example? I’d forgotten to take my wallet to the supermarket. I had a stroke of luck. I spotted Susan at the ice cream counter.”
“I thought she was on a diet! Anyway, it’s also possible to say ‘a piece of luck’. You need an incredible piece of luck to get a house like that for that price.”
“I think I had an incredible piece of luck when I spotted these sandals on sale. What do you think? Don’t they look great?”
“Look great? They look pretty ugly, if you ask me. I mean…”
“But let me tell you, they’re very comfortable. I can now walk with comfort.”
“Not ‘with comfort’, but ‘walk in comfort’. You usually walk with someone or something. For example, when he was young, Mohan was always embarrassed to walk to school with his little sister.”
“I had no problem walking to school with my grandmother.”
“Good for you. Do you think you will…”
“The ad says that the sandals will enable people to walk in comfort.”
“I don’t pay much attention to ads. My neighbour, Mr. Singh, walks with a limp.”
“Mr. Singh? You mean the former Principal… I mean the ‘sometime’ Principal of my school?”
“Well done!”
I believe in luck: how else can you explain the success of those you dislike? — John Cocteau`

  text:`“I know that look. You’re in some kind of trouble again, aren’t you?”
“You’re right. I went out with Jayant yesterday, and he…”
“How many times have I told you not to have anything to do with Jayant? Keep away from him. Every time you go out with him, you get into a pretty pickle.”
“A pretty pickle? What are you talking about? How can a pickle be pretty?”
“The word ‘pickle’ in this rather informal expression means a difficult situation.”
“I see. So, when you say that someone is in a pretty pickle, you mean he’s in a tight spot. He’s in trouble.”
“That’s right! Just like you, he’s in a messy situation and doesn’t know what to do about it. If you quit your job now, you’ll be in a pretty pickle.”
“My father was in a pretty pickle when he lost his wallet during his trip to London.”
“That’s a good example. You’ll find yourself in a legal pickle, if you don’t repay your loans soon.”
“You’d be in a pretty pickle if your landlord walked into your apartment right now. The painters finished their job a week ago. Why haven’t you put things away?”
“I was too tired to clean up. I spent most of the weekend chillaxing.”
“Chillaxing? Does it mean you spent the weekend relaxing?”
“Very good! The word ‘chillaxing’ is a combination of ‘chilling’ and ‘relaxing’. When you ‘chillax’, you chill or calm yourself down and then relax. You have a good time doing nothing.”
“If you want to become rich, you need to work hard. You can’t make it big by chillaxing.”
“My cousin doesn’t go anywhere on weekends. He chillaxes at home.”
“So, are you planning to chillax next weekend as well?”
“Can’t afford to. I have an important meeting on Monday, so I have to…”
“Oh that’s right! Jayant told me about the meeting. It’s with his brother, isn’t it?”
“Really? I didn’t know that Mukund was Jayant’s brother. Is he…”
“According to Jayant, you and Mukund are very good friends.”
“Good friends! Not a chance! How can we be good friends when we haven’t even met each other? Mukund is what I would call an e-quaintance.”
“An ‘e-quaintance’? What does it mean?
“The word is a combination of ‘e’ and ‘acquaintance’. An ‘e-quaintance’ is a friend you’ve made online. All your interactions have been online. You haven’t met the individual.”
“Like everyone else, I have many e-quaintances. How does that sound?”
“Sounds great! Tell me, is my e-quaintance anything like your friend, Jayant?”
“Not really. They’re rather different. But like Jayant, Mukund has the habit of disagreeing to whatever…”
“When you have an opinion that is very different from others, you ‘disagree with’ them. The word ‘disagree’ is not followed by ‘to’. I flatly disagreed with him on his findings.”
“Most teenagers disagree with their parents about everything.”
“That’s a good example. If you leave now, I can continue with my chillaxing.”
We may not all agree, but if we disagree let us not be disagreeable in our disagreements. — M R DeHaan`
