          text: `Hey, come on in! Good to see you. Happy New Year!”
“How can it be a happy one when I have assignments and tests hanging over my head? It’s just crazy how many....”
“Are you planning to be a grouch this year?”
“A what?”
“Grouch! It rhymes with ‘pouch’ and ‘crouch’. Do you know what grouch means?”
“Someone who is grouchy. Someone who is in a terrible mood all the time.”
“In other words, someone like you! A grouch is also a habitual complainer. For example, they tell me that Sandeep is the office grouch.”
“No way! Why would they think that Sandeep is a grouch? My uncle is a grouch.”
“According to my cousins, I’m the certified grouch in my family.”
“Are they crazy? You’re no grouch. Why would they think that you....”
“What’s gotten into you? Why so many questions? Is it because of the tests or....”
“No, I’m just curious. Why would your cousins think that you....”
“Curious, eh? Remember, curiosity killed the cat.”
“Curiosity killed the cat? What are you talking about?”
“It’s an expression used to warn someone. You’re telling the person not to poke his nose into other people’s business. Not to ask too many questions.”
“In other words, not to get too curious about things.”
“Exactly! If you do, chances are you’ll get into trouble. Whenever Sujatha asks too many personal questions, I remind her that curiosity killed the cat.”
“Curiosity killed the cat! That’s what I’ll say the next time you ask a lot of questions. Tell me, how is your office grouch doing?”
“Oh, Sandeep is doing fine. Getting used to his new job. Whenever he gets into trouble, his Man Friday helps him out.”
“Man Friday? What are you talking about?”
“The expression is normally used to refer to your right hand man. Someone...”
“Someone who does whatever you want him to, and who can be trusted.”
“Exactly! Man Friday was the name that Robinson Crusoe gave the man he rescued from cannibals. This man became his trusted servant and later his friend.”
“In many of PG Wodehouse’s novels, Jeeves is Bertie Wooster’s Man Friday.”
“That’s a good example. Nowadays, the expression is used to refer to one’s office assistant. At the office, Manjunath is my Man Friday.”
“If the person helping you is a woman, then....”
“You can refer to her as your ‘Girl Friday’. Pallavi is my boss’ Girl Friday.”
“Mrs. Shyamala Rao is the Principal’s Girl Friday. But if you ask him, he’ll deny to it.”
“One doesn’t ‘deny to’ something. One usually denies it. Sashi was accused of cheating people, but he denied it.”
“The children denied they had taken money from their father’s wallet.”
“Good example. On the witness stand, the Minister denied he taken a bribe.”
“Do you think his Man Friday took it for him? It’s possible...”
“Remember what happened to the cat who got too curious?”
“May you spend lesser time online this New Year and more with the real people who fill up your world. Happy New Year!” Unknown`

            text: `“We’re planning to see ‘La La Land’ in Prasad’s today. Does the title mean anything?”
“La-la land is an expression used in informal contexts in American English. When you say that someone is in ‘la-la land’, you mean that the person has no clue what is going on around him. He is out of touch with reality.”
“Like some of our politicians, I guess! How about this example? If you think that cricket is still a gentleman’s game, you’re living in la-la land.”
“Sounds good! It’s difficult to talk to Ganesh. Most of the time he’s off in la-la land.”
“I think I understand what la-la land means. Can we...”
“The expression is also used to refer to the city of Los Angeles.”
“Los Angeles? But what’s the connection between....”
“Los Angeles is usually abbreviated to LA. And one of the things that LA is famous for is Hollywood.”
“Hollywood movies. The world of make believe.”
“That’s right. By the way, my friends and I went to the new restaurant you’d recommended. The food was okay, but the place had no zing.”
“No zing? What are you talking about?”
“There was no life in the place. It was very dull, absolutely no energy.”
“I see. How about this example? Virat Kohli brings a lot of zing into the team.”
“He certainly does, doesn’t he? On New Year’s Eve, my friends and I like to be in a place with a lot of zing in it.”
“So, have you decided where you’ll be going this year? Two days back, you were....”
“How many times do I have to tell you? It’s not two days back, but two days ago. I met my cousin six months ago. Not six months back.”
“I went to Chennai a year ago. Now tell me, are you going to Goa....”
“That’s where I’d like to go. But right now, among my friends, Bali seems to be the flavour of the month.”
“Flavour of the month? Does it mean the most popular vacation spot? The one...”
“When you say that something is the flavour of the month, what you mean is that it is the most popular thing at the moment. The expression can be used with people as well. As far as tennis is concerned, Del Potro seems to be the flavour of the month.”
“My father tells me that bell bottoms were the flavour of the month in the early 70s.”
“That’s a good example. Sindhu is the flavour of the month with my boss. He thinks....”
“What about you? Were you ever the flavour of the month?”
“Never! I made the mistake of zinging his very first proposal, and since then...”
“Zinging his proposal? Does it mean you enthusiastically supported the proposal?”
“I did the exact opposite. The word ‘zing’ can be used as a verb to mean to criticise. The Opposition is taking great delight in zinging the policies of the PM.”
“President-Elect Trump gets zinged quite a bit on the late-night comedy shows.”
“In Parliament, our politicians waste their time and our money zinging each other.”
“That’s true!

  text:`“I thought you were going to spend time with some important person from your Delhi office. Weren’t you planning to take him to your...?”
“It’s a her, actually. She wants to see our new office tomorrow. My boss’ instructions were to do whatever the big cheese told me to.”
“Big cheese? What are you talking about?”
“The expression ‘big cheese’ is used in informal contexts to refer to an important person in an organisation. He or she is very influential.”
“I see. My cousin Anil is a big cheese in the company he works for.”
“I’m told Sangeetha is likely to become a big cheese in Reliance.”
“That’s great! Tell me about this expression big cheese. Why cheese?”
“It has nothing to do with the cheese we eat. Some scholars believe that the English took the Hindi expression ‘bada cheez’ meaning ‘big thing’ and changed it to ‘big cheese’.”
“That’s interesting. Is the big cheese staying in some fancy hotel?”
“Yes. Apparently, she’s been travelling a lot of late. Said that she’s been practically living out of a suitcase for the past four  months.”
“What do you mean by ‘living out of a suitcase’? Never heard that expression before.”
“The expression is mostly used to refer to someone who is constantly travelling or moving from one place to another. He doesn’t have the time to unpack, and...”
“He merely grabs whatever is there in his suitcase.”
“Exactly! Clementine’s husband keeps changing jobs every two months. She says that they’ve been living out of a suitcase for nearly a year now.”
“That’s tough. So how long is the big cheese here?”
“I think it’s a two-week visit. After that, she...”
“Two week visit? You mean two weeks visit, don’t you?”
“No, it’s ‘two-week visit’ because ‘week’ here is functioning as an adjective and not as a noun. The washing machine comes with a four-year warranty. Not four years.”
“I plan to run the twenty-mile marathon. I think I understand now. Is the big cheese unhappy with all the travelling?”
“No. When she took the job, she knew she’d have to live out of a suitcase for a while.”
“What’s she like? Is she well liked by the people in your company? I mean...”
“People who work under her like her a lot. They say she’s squeaky clean.”
“Squeaky clean? Does it mean very clean?”
“Yes, that’s one of the meanings. When you say that someone’s house was squeaky clean, you mean it was very clean. You couldn’t find dirt anywhere.”
“Some important clients are coming for dinner tonight. My mother wants the plates and glasses to be squeaky clean.”
“That’s a good example. When the expression is used with people, it means someone who is upstanding; someone who hasn’t done anything wrong.”
“In other words, an honest individual. Someone who doesn’t take advantage of his position.”
“Exactly! The newly appointed DIG has a squeaky clean image.”
“Most people would say no politician has a squeaky clean image.”
“My boss has the reputation of being squeaky clean.”
“I’m not so sure about that!”
People think that being famous is so glamorous, but half the time you’re in a strange hotel living out of a suitcase. — Ja Rule`

        text: `“You’re late again! Wow! Where did you get those sandals? They’re ubercool.”
“Ubercool? Uber is the name of a taxi company, isn’t it? Why...”
“I understand that ‘uber’ is actually a German word meaning ‘over’. It is frequently used nowadays in English before nouns to mean ‘extremely’ or ‘super’. When used with a person, you mean that he is a great example of something.”
“I see. So, can I say, uberbatsman Virat Kohli will score three centuries in the series?”
“I guess you could. It was a star-studded event. But uberstar Amitabh was missing.”
“How about this example? Rajiv wants to buy his wife an uber expensive car.”
“It’s not going to happen. Ubermillionaire Rajiv is very careful with his money.”
“Unlike your friend Rajiv who has no clue how to save the little money he has.”
“Rajiv is more a frenemy than a friend, actually. He is...”
“Frenemy? What does it mean?”
“It’s a combination of the words ‘friend’ and ‘enemy’. A ‘frenemy’ is someone who...”
“He probably pretends to be your friend, but can’t really stand you.”
“It looks like the two of you are on friendly terms, but there is intense rivalry and dislike...”
“I see. Do you think Tendulkar and Shoaib Akhtar are frenemies?”
“I have no idea. I see some of my colleagues as being my frenemies.”
“That’s interesting. You look relaxed. Did you enjoy your day out with your friends?”
“I didn’t go out with my friends. Thought about it, but decided not to. You...”
“But why? You’ve been looking forward to the trip for...”
“Had a really tough week. I needed to chill. I decided I needed some me time.”
“Me time? What does it mean?”
“It’s time for yourself. The time you spend relaxing doing the kind of things you want to. Usually, on your own. This morning I spent my me time cleaning the car.”
“Cleaning the car is your idea of me time? You’re crazy.”
“I find it relaxing. My father’s idea of me time is to sit in a rocking chair on the terrace and listen to Carnatic music.”
“With exams around the corner, I really don’t get much me time. How does that sound?”
“Sounds great. You were supposed to have been here an hour ago. What happened?”
“We told our physics teacher that we were worried about her paper. She said there was nothing to worry about, and gave us a pep talk.”
“A pep talk? Did you know...”
“A pep talk is something that people give in order to encourage you. Coaches usually give their players a pep talk before a big game.”
“It can also be given to get people enthusiastic about something. Our team leader gives a pep talk every Monday morning. Did you know that ‘pep’ is actually the shortened form of ‘pepper’?”
“Pep comes from pepper? But what’s the connection between...”
“One of the meanings of pepper was ‘energy, spirit’. Now, please leave. I have...”
“But I just got here.”
“I know! I need some me time before I start on my project.”

    text: `“I saw your cousin’s car this morning. It looks almost new. Where did he...”
“It looks great, doesn’t it? You know something? He paid only two lakhs for it.”
“ Some people are lucky, I must say. That’s a pretty big car! And he paid peanuts for it!”
“Paid peanuts for it? What are you talking about?”
“When you say that you paid peanuts for something or you bought something for peanuts, you mean that you paid very little money for it. You got the item rather cheap.”
“I see. How about this example? For a man of my uncle’s experience, the salary the company is offering him is peanuts.”
“Sounds good. We have so many engineers in our country that many of them are forced to work for peanuts.”
“I know. Some of my seniors are getting paid only nine or ten thousand a month.”
“That kind of salary is considered peanuts these days. Anyway, tell me what’s happening with Jai’s daughter, Anuradha? Did she get into the State team?”
“Unfortunately, she didn’t. She’s very depressed about it. She’s thinking of quitting.”
“Quitting? That wouldn’t be a smart thing to do. Tell her to keep her chin up and do...”
“Chin up? I’ve never heard that expression before. What does it mean?”
“When you tell someone to keep his chin up, you’re asking him to stay positive - no matter how difficult or terrible the situation may seem. You’re telling him to remain cheerful.”
“So, it’s an expression that you usually use when you wish to encourage someone. I’m going to ask Anuradha to keep her chin up and continue with her training.”
“Good example. The players were devastated when they conceded the second goal. The coach told them to keep their chin up and keep fighting.”
“When Madhuri’s first movie bombed at the box office, she didn’t get depressed. She kept her chin up and worked really hard. Today, she’s a superstar.”
“I know. My uncle was talking about her the other day, and he...”
“Did you tell him about your promotion? Was he happy to...”
“My uncle was telling me about his health problems. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise.”
“Couldn’t get a word in edgewise? Does it mean he didn’t let you talk?”
“It means that I didn’t get an opportunity to say what I wanted to. My uncle was speaking non-stop. I was unable to say anything.”
“It’s like trying to talk to Sujatha when she’s angry, I guess. When she gets angry, you simply can’t get a word in edgewise.”
“That’s a good example. It’s also possible to say ‘edgeways’. I wanted to explain to the Manager why I was late, but I couldn’t get a word in edgeways.”
“It was supposed to be a press conference. But the Minister reduced it to a monologue. The poor reporters couldn’t get a word in  edgeways.”
“Our politicians are famous for that. They like the sound of their own voice.”
“They have to like it. Nobody else does!”

“It was quite lively for a change. A few old men whom I’d never seen before piped up. They had a lot of things...”
“Piped up? Does it mean that they spoke... they had things to say?”
“That’s right! When you ‘pipe up’, you interrupt others and say something. You speak quite unexpectedly. Someone from the back row piped up, ‘How long do we have to sit in these uncomfortable chairs?’ Everyone laughed.”
“I’m sure Rahul will pipe up when he realises that his letters are not being taken seriously. That reminds me, I need to call him. Can I borrow your phone?”
“Borrow my phone? Where’s yours? Did you lose it?”
“I don’t think so. It could be quite possible that I left it in Rahul’s house.”
“You don’t normally use ‘could’ or ‘can’ before ‘possible’. You normally say, ‘it is possible’ and not ‘could be possible’ — especially when you’re talking about a past event.”
“So, I have to say, ‘It’s quite possible that I left the phone in Rahul’s house’.”
“Good! It’s quite possible that they went to the wrong hotel.”
“Talking about hotels, did you and Ajit go to the new restaurant yesterday?”
“Yes, we did. The food wasn’t anything great, but we managed to...”
“You should worry about the food only when you are paying for it. Last night’s dinner was Ajit’s treat, wasn’t it?”
“That’s what I thought. But when the bill arrived, he said we should go Dutch.” “Go Dutch? What does it mean?”
“When you go Dutch, you agree to share the cost of something with someone. You end up paying half the amount.”
“I can understand college students going Dutch when they go to a restaurant. But why would people with good jobs go Dutch? It doesn’t make sense. Both of you have money.”
“Let’s just say that Ajit is very careful with his. He always insists on going Dutch.”
“When Shekar took Gayathri to a movie, she insisted that they go Dutch.”
“Good for her. Is Gayathri the person who keeps saying ‘good morning’, no matter...”
“That’s right! Like many people in our country, she says ‘good morning’ at three o’clock in the afternoon. But it’s okay, right? Especially, if you happen to be seeing the person for the first time that day.”
“No, it’s not okay. You usually wish someone ‘good morning’ before noon. Anything after twelve o’clock, you usually say ‘good afternoon’ or good evening’. Depending on what time of day it is.”
“So ‘good morning’ has nothing to do with whether you’re seeing a person for the first time or not?”
“No, it doesn’t! If I see you for the first time at two o’clock in the afternoon, I have to wish you ‘good afternoon’, and not ‘good morning’. That’s what a native speaker would do. If you wish someone ‘good morning’ at three o’clock in the afternoon, he’ll probably think you’re trying to be funny!”

“So, are you the one ordering or giving the harsh punishment? Are you...”
“It could be anyone. It could be you or someone else. For example, the students were highly critical of the treatment meted out to the workers.”
“How about this example? Judges are reluctant to mete out harsh sentences against crooked politicians. I think they should.”
“Sounds good. Even today, there are many teachers in our country who believe it’s okay to mete out punishment to little children.”
“I certainly don’t! In fact, I feel that we should .......”
“Please, you need to lighten up. You have a tendency to.....”
“Lighten up? Are you telling me that I have put on weight and that I need to....”
“No, I don’t want you to go on a diet. When you tell someone that he should lighten up, what you’re suggesting is that the individual should learn to relax.”
“You want him to stop taking everything that is being said very seriously.”
“That’s right. The new teacher is very serious in class. She needs to lighten up.”
“Shreya had been tense all morning. But once she heard she’d got the promotion, she lightened up.”
“Revathi lightened up during our trip to Hyderabad. I’ve never...”
“Oh yes, you went to Hyderabad, didn’t you? How was the seminar?”
“It was okay. Nobody had anything new to say. But I did manage to see quite a few places in Hyderabad.”
“Did you go to the Salar Jung Museum? They say it’s great.”
“It is, actually. I wanted to spend at least half a day there. But unfortunately, my boss’ brother-in-law had tagged along with us and he...”
“Tagged along? Does it mean he went along with you?”
“You could say that. When someone tags along with you, he accompanies you even though you haven’t asked him to.”
“In other words, he’s like an uninvited guest. He forces himself on you.”
“Exactly! Whenever Raman took Laxmi to a movie, her brother tagged along with them.”
“That couldn’t have been fun. When I went out with my friends, I made it very clear to my parents that I didn’t want my younger brother tagging along with us.”
“The puppy tagged along wherever we went. Despite being...”
“Tell me, is there a difference between ‘despite’ and ‘in spite’? I mean is....”
“In terms of meaning, there is not much of a difference. You can use the two words interchangeably in most contexts. Just remember that ‘in spite’ is always followed by ‘of’ and ‘despite’ is not. The children continued to play in spite of/despite the rain.”
“In spite of/Despite his brilliant performance in the league matches, Rahul wasn’t selected for the State team.”
“That’s politics for you. I’ve got to go to the supermarket. I need...”

“It means a long list of complaints. The items on the list may or may not be related.”
“So they aren’t really genuine complaints? You’re complaining for the....”
“They may be genuine. You’re not complaining for the sake of complaining. But the problem is, it’s a lengthy list. When I asked Usha how I could help, she gave me a laundry list of things to do.”
“My friend moved into a new apartment a few months ago. Every time I talk to her, she gives me a laundry list of problems.”

“Talking about new flats, have you decided whether you’re buying a new one? Has...”
“It’s up in the air. I was planning to...”
“Up in the air? Does it mean that you haven’t made up your mind?”
“Very good! When you say that something is up in the air, it suggests uncertainty. You haven’t really decided what to do regarding someone or something. The company’s plan to hire more people is still up in the air.”
“No decision has been taken. Our trip to Shimla in December is still up in the air.”
“Sounds good. The proposal to build a new airport on the outskirts of the city is still up in the air.”
“I don’t think it’ll ever happen. Five years from now, the government will give a laundry list of excuses why they couldn’t build the airport.”
“Just like you! I’m sure you and your classmates had some lame excuse for not submitting your project today.”
“Most of my friends managed to submit their project, but a few of us have managed to get some extra time to hand it in.”
“Why are you making such heavy weather of a minor project?”
“I’ve heard of hot and cold weather. But heavy weather? What are you....”
“When you say that someone is making heavy weather of something, it means that the person is taking too much time to do something that is fairly simple.”
“I see. So, you’re saying that I’m making the project seem much more difficult than it really is!”
“That’s right! Just like the Indian batsmen. The bowling was mediocre, but our batsmen made heavy weather of it.”
“This is a simple recipe. You should be able to make the dish in twenty minutes. Don’t make heavy weather of it.”
“That's a good example. Now, you’d better go home and work on your project.”
“You’re right. If I don’t do a good job, they’ll make me to do it again.”
“They’ll make you do it again. Not make you to do it again.”
“If I don’t do a good job, they’ll make me do another project.”

“Like many policeman, he was probably out of shape. Here’s my example. The children ran after the cute puppy. Now tell me, what does ‘run at’ mean?”

“A slacktivist is like an activist. He too supports a political or social cause. But unlike an activist, a slacktivist is lazy. He’s a slacker.”
“A slacker? Does it mean someone who is lazy?”
“That’s right! He is someone who avoids both work and responsibilities. He…”
“Can I say our government offices are full of slackers?”
“I think a lot of people would agree with you. All the slackers in our office were demoted.”
“That’s good to know. Now, tell me what a slacktivist does.”
“He doesn’t participate in all the rallies and meetings. He doesn’t even step out of his house.”
“Then how does a slacktivist show support?”
“Through the Internet! He signs online petitions. He promotes a cause by posting articles written by other people on his social networking sites.”
“Well, in that case, quite a few of my friends and cousins are slacktivists.”
“Another term for such people is ‘armchair activists’. When Usha says that she’s going to support something, she actually does it. She’s not an armchair activist.”
“When do you think Pritham will become like Usha? When will she stop being a slacktivist?”
“Who knows? Maybe when she feels like her old self again. Or when she…”
“Old self? What are you talking about? Pritham is very young. She…”
“The expression has nothing to do with age. When you say that you’re feeling like your old self again, what you’re suggesting is that you’re feeling like your former self. The way you were before. After the surgery, I feel like my old self again. I don’t feel tired anymore.”
“So, can I say, he’s not been his old self since the accident?”
“You certainly can.”
