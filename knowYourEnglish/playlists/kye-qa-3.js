          text: `How is the word ‘acquiesce’ pronounced?
The first syllable sounds like the ‘ack’ in ‘sack’, ‘pack’ and ‘back’; the following ‘qui’ sounds like the ‘wi’ in ‘wit’, ‘will’ and ‘win’. The final syllable is pronounced like the ‘es’ in ‘yes’, ‘mess’ and ‘chess’. The word is pronounced ‘ak-wi-ES’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘acquiescere’ meaning ‘to become quiet’ or ‘remain at rest’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used in formal contexts to mean to agree to something a person has said. You do what the person tells you to, although very reluctantly. You make no attempt to protest; you remain silent.

Can the word ‘snake’ be used as a verb?
Yes, it can. The word ‘snake’ can be used as a noun and a verb. When used as a verb, it suggests that you are moving like a snake — you are not moving in a straight line, but are twisting and turning quite frequently. Think of the people driving a motorcycle or a scooter through traffic in our country — and you get the picture. The expressions ‘snake around’, ‘snake through’, and so on, are mostly used to suggest that there are many twisting curves. When you say that the road snakes its way through the mountain, what you are suggesting is that it is a winding road with a lot of curves.

What is the meaning of ‘lodestar’?
This word has been in the news ever since the anonymous op-ed against the U.S. President Donald Trump was published in The New York Times. There is speculation that the author could be Vice President Pence because ‘lodestar’ is a word that he frequently uses in his conversations and speeches. The first syllable, by the way, is pronounced the same way as ‘load’. The term ‘lodestar’ was first used to refer to the polestar or the North Star. In the past, sailors used it for navigation. The word ‘lode’ originally meant ‘way’ or ‘course’. Sailors used the lodestar as a reference point to find their way home. Nowadays, the word is used to refer to someone or something that is seen as a model or guide. Like the actual star, this individual guides people; he sets an example for others to follow. The word can be used with things as well; the beliefs that you have which often determine your action can be referred to as your lodestar.

          text: `What is the difference between ‘populous’ and ‘popular’? 
Both words come from the Latin ‘populus’ meaning ‘people’. Of the two, ‘popular’ is much more frequently used than ‘populous’. When you say that someone is ‘popular’, what you are suggesting is that the person is liked or admired by many people. A restaurant that is ‘popular’ is frequented by many people; a lot of people eat there. ‘Populous’, on the other hand, is mostly used with a place — it could be a country, state, area, etc. When you say that a place is ‘populous’, what you are suggesting is that it is full of people; it is ‘densely populated’. India, for example, has a very big population — it is a populous country.
These types of shoes are popular with teenagers.
I don’t wish to live in a populous metropolitan city after I retire.
By the way, the word ‘pop’ in ‘pop music’ — the kind of music that a lot of people like to listen to — is actually a contraction of ‘popular’.
How is the word ‘emolument’; pronounced? 
The first vowel sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘kit’, while the second is like the ‘o’ in ‘cot’, ‘got’ and ‘hot’. The ‘u’ sounds like the ‘ou’ in ‘could’; and ‘would’ and the final ‘e’ is pronounced like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘i-MOL-yu-ment’; with the stress on the second syllable. Like ‘popular’ and ‘populous’, this word too is of Latin origin. It comes from ‘emolumentum’ meaning ‘profit’ or ‘gain’. In Latin ‘emolere’ means ‘grind out’; the word emolument was first used to refer to the money that people paid the miller for grinding their corn. Nowadays, of course, the word is used to refer to the payment one receives for the work one has done — it could be in the form of cash or something else.
What is the meaning of ‘history sheeter’?
Not all standard dictionaries list the terms ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy sheeter’; those that do include them make it clear that they are examples of Indian English. The terms are used in our country to refer to a person with a criminal record — someone who has been arrested by the police. Native speakers of English refer to the sheet that the police use to list the crimes committed by an individual as ‘rap sheet’. In India, it is called ‘history sheet’. It contains the history of the crimes that the individual has committed or has been accused of committing. The term ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy history sheeter’ were coined to refer to someone who has a criminal record —- someone who has a ‘history sheet’. Native speakers, however, do not refer to someone with a ‘rap sheet’ as a ‘rap sheeter’.

Which is correct ‘discharge from hospital’ or ‘release from hospital’? 
Dictionaries on collocations suggest that ‘discharge’ is the appropriate word. When you say that someone was released from hospital, it suggests that the authorities forced the individual to stay — much against his will. I suppose this is possible in the case of psychiatric patients. In most cases, people would use ‘discharge’.
A hospital should also have a recovery room adjoining the cashier’s office — Francis Owalsh`
