          text: `What is the difference between ‘semi-monthly’ and ‘bimonthly’?
The word ‘bimonthly’ is rather ambiguous; it has two very different meanings. A magazine that is published twice a month — i.e. every two weeks — can be called a ‘bimonthly’. The term, however, can also be used to refer to a journal or magazine that is published once in two months. Americans, in general, prefer ‘semi-monthly’, and they frequently use the word to mean ‘twice a month’.
We decided that the new publication was going to be a semi-monthly/bimonthly.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘happy as a sandboy’? 
This rather old-fashioned expression is mostly limited to British English; the idiom was quite popular till the 19th century. The original expression was ‘jolly as a sandboy’. When you say that someone is ‘happy as a sandboy’, what you are suggesting is that the individual is extremely happy about something. The idiom has more or less the same meaning as ‘happy as a clam at high tide’. In the old days, the word ‘boy’ was frequently used to refer to a man who did menial work; a male worker of low status. This probably explains why the men who look after cattle and work on ranches are called ‘cowboys’, and why men who work in hotels and carry people’s suitcases are called ‘bellboys’. Several centuries ago, sand was used as a form of floor covering in theatres, bars, houses, etc.; whenever someone spilt something or spit on the floor, the sand absorbed it. Sandboys were hired to spread the sand on the floor and also remove it at regular intervals. Though these individuals were seldom paid in cash, they always remained in excellent spirits — the free drinks that they received ensured they always remained happy.
Ramana was happy as a sandboy when the company promoted him.
He’s happy as a sandboy when his grandchildren play with him.
What is the meaning of ‘moonstruck’?
Many people believe that the moon somehow influences the way human beings behave. There are many stories about how on a full moon night, some people transform into werewolves. When you say that someone is ‘moonstruck’, you are suggesting that the individual is acting in an odd manner — the person is in love and is therefore not himself; he is acting in a crazy or foolish manner.
Don’t pay any attention to Priya. She’s moonstruck.
When the actor stepped out of the club, moonstruck teenagers mobbed him.
How is the word ‘mollycoddle’ pronounced?
The first word rhymes with ‘jolly’, ‘volley’, and ‘poly’. The ‘cod’ in ‘coddle’ rhymes with ‘god’, ‘pod’, and ‘mod’, and the second syllable sounds like the ‘dle’ in ‘middle’ and ‘fiddle’. The word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, is pronounced ‘MO-li cod-el’ with the main stress on the first syllable of ‘molly’. When you mollycoddle your children, you are being overly protective. The word also suggests that you indulge them too much; in other words, you make sure that all their wants and demands are met.
Like any grandmother, she took great delight in mollycoddling her grandchild.
I don’t understand why the government is mollycoddling the power industry.

The first syllable sounds like the ‘ack’ in ‘sack’, ‘pack’ and ‘back’; the following ‘qui’ sounds like the ‘wi’ in ‘wit’, ‘will’ and ‘win’. The final syllable is pronounced like the ‘es’ in ‘yes’, ‘mess’ and ‘chess’. The word is pronounced ‘ak-wi-ES’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘acquiescere’ meaning ‘to become quiet’ or ‘remain at rest’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used in formal contexts to mean to agree to something a person has said. You do what the person tells you to, although very reluctantly. You make no attempt to protest; you remain silent.
The new Vice Chancellor refused to acquiesce to the students’ demands.
All three police officials acquiesced to the Minister’s plans.
Can the word ‘snake’ be used as a verb?
Yes, it can. The word ‘snake’ can be used as a noun and a verb. When used as a verb, it suggests that you are moving like a snake — you are not moving in a straight line, but are twisting and turning quite frequently. Think of the people driving a motorcycle or a scooter through traffic in our country — and you get the picture. The expressions ‘snake around’, ‘snake through’, and so on, are mostly used to suggest that there are many twisting curves. When you say that the road snakes its way through the mountain, what you are suggesting is that it is a winding road with a lot of curves.
There was a long queue to get in. It snaked around the stadium.
What is the meaning of ‘lodestar’?
This word has been in the news ever since the anonymous op-ed against the U.S. President Donald Trump was published in The New York Times. There is speculation that the author could be Vice President Pence because ‘lodestar’ is a word that he frequently uses in his conversations and speeches. The first syllable, by the way, is pronounced the same way as ‘load’. The term ‘lodestar’ was first used to refer to the polestar or the North Star. In the past, sailors used it for navigation. The word ‘lode’ originally meant ‘way’ or ‘course’. Sailors used the lodestar as a reference point to find their way home. Nowadays, the word is used to refer to someone or something that is seen as a model or guide. Like the actual star, this individual guides people; he sets an example for others to follow. The word can be used with things as well; the beliefs that you have which often determine your action can be referred to as your lodestar.
A few people sniggered when the Minister said that serving people had been his lodestar all through his life.
Federer still continues be the lodestar for many tennis enthusiasts.
Which is correct: We are going on holiday/holidays to France?
The standard expression is ‘on holiday’. For example, you can say, ‘The children went on holiday to Kashmir’. If you wish to use ‘holidays’, then you normally say, ‘The children went to Kashmir for the holidays’.
Where is Prithi going for the holidays?
We’re planning to go to the Maldives on holiday.

Both words come from the Latin ‘populus’ meaning ‘people’. Of the two, ‘popular’ is much more frequently used than ‘populous’. When you say that someone is ‘popular’, what you are suggesting is that the person is liked or admired by many people. A restaurant that is ‘popular’ is frequented by many people; a lot of people eat there. ‘Populous’, on the other hand, is mostly used with a place — it could be a country, state, area, etc. When you say that a place is ‘populous’, what you are suggesting is that it is full of people; it is ‘densely populated’. India, for example, has a very big population — it is a populous country.
These types of shoes are popular with teenagers.
I don’t wish to live in a populous metropolitan city after I retire.
By the way, the word ‘pop’ in ‘pop music’ — the kind of music that a lot of people like to listen to — is actually a contraction of ‘popular’.
How is the word ‘emolument’; pronounced? 
The first vowel sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘kit’, while the second is like the ‘o’ in ‘cot’, ‘got’ and ‘hot’. The ‘u’ sounds like the ‘ou’ in ‘could’; and ‘would’ and the final ‘e’ is pronounced like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘i-MOL-yu-ment’; with the stress on the second syllable. Like ‘popular’ and ‘populous’, this word too is of Latin origin. It comes from ‘emolumentum’ meaning ‘profit’ or ‘gain’. In Latin ‘emolere’ means ‘grind out’; the word emolument was first used to refer to the money that people paid the miller for grinding their corn. Nowadays, of course, the word is used to refer to the payment one receives for the work one has done — it could be in the form of cash or something else.
What is the meaning of ‘history sheeter’?
Not all standard dictionaries list the terms ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy sheeter’; those that do include them make it clear that they are examples of Indian English. The terms are used in our country to refer to a person with a criminal record — someone who has been arrested by the police. Native speakers of English refer to the sheet that the police use to list the crimes committed by an individual as ‘rap sheet’. In India, it is called ‘history sheet’. It contains the history of the crimes that the individual has committed or has been accused of committing. The term ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy history sheeter’ were coined to refer to someone who has a criminal record —- someone who has a ‘history sheet’. Native speakers, however, do not refer to someone with a ‘rap sheet’ as a ‘rap sheeter’.
Chances are, the well-known history sheeter, will be our next CM.
The police refused to file an FIR against the rowdy history sheeter.
Which is correct ‘discharge from hospital’ or ‘release from hospital’? 
Dictionaries on collocations suggest that ‘discharge’ is the appropriate word. When you say that someone was released from hospital, it suggests that the authorities forced the individual to stay — much against his will. I suppose this is possible in the case of psychiatric patients. In most cases, people would use ‘discharge’.

        text: `What is the difference between ‘officious’ and ‘official’?
The word ‘official’ is frequently used in everyday contexts to refer to someone who has the authority or the power to do something. People talk about ‘police official’, ‘government official’, and so on. The word can be used as a noun and an adjective when you talk about the ‘official spokesperson’ of a political party, you mean that he is the authorised or appointed individual. The word ‘officious’ (e-FISH-es), on the other hand, is used only as an adjective, and it has a rather negative meaning. When you say that someone is ‘officious’, you mean that he is an official who asserts his authority very aggressively even in the case of trivial matters. This individual has an inflated opinion about his importance. The word has another meaning as well someone who meddles in other people’s business can also be called ‘officious’.
The officious clerk seldom looked at people and always sounded rude.
What I like about Dilip’s parents is that they’re seldom officious.
How is the word ‘debonair’ pronounced?
The ‘e’ in the first syllable of this old-fashioned word is like the ‘e’ in ‘set’, ‘pet’ and ‘get’, and the following ‘o’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The final syllable rhymes with ‘bare’, ‘care’ and ‘share’. The word is pronounced ‘deb-e-NARE’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the French ‘de bon’ aire’ meaning ‘of good race’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used with men. When you refer to a man as being ‘debonair’, what you are suggesting is that he is a charming, confident and stylishly dressed individual. Ladies are usually drawn to his charm and sophistication.
Who’s the debonair man in the three-piece suit?
Girls swooned when the debonair professor walked into the classroom.
What is the meaning of the expression ‘meet someone half way’?
This is an expression mostly used in informal contexts to mean ‘to compromise’. When you negotiate with someone, what is it that usually happens? You make certain demands, and then proceed to negotiate with the other party. They may be willing to meet some of your demands, but not all. In order to reach an agreement, both of you compromise; you do not insist on all your demands being met. The two of you arrive at an agreement by each one of you giving up something. When two parties meet each other half way, they agree to do a part of what the other wants.
The bill couldn’t be passed because the Opposition wasn’t willing to meet the Government half way.
I wanted 60 lakhs for the flat and Abdul was quoting 50. We both met halfway and settled on 55 lakhs.
Is it okay to say, ‘You’d better take care of not shouting at Jyothi’?
No, it is not. The expression ‘take care of’ is usually used to mean to look after someone. We normally talk about ‘taking care of one’s parents/children/health’, etc. In the example that you have given, you are not requesting someone to look after Jyothi. What you would like the person to do is not shout at Jyothi. We normally say, ‘You’d better take care not to shout at Jyothi’.

        text: `What is the meaning and origin of ‘at loggerheads’?
The expression has been part of the English language for several centuries, and nowadays its use is mostly limited to informal contexts. When two individuals or two groups of people are at loggerheads, they strongly or violently disagree about something. They are engaged in a serious dispute and fail to come to an understanding of any kind.
The Administration and the students have been at loggerheads over fees.
Sheela has been at loggerheads with her father over how many people to invite to the wedding.
‘Loggerhead’ originally referred to a thick-headed tool made of iron. It had an extremely long handle, and shipbuilders used it to heat and melt tar. With the passage of time, the navy realised that loggerheads could be employed as weapons as well. When an enemy ship was sighted, sailors were ordered to melt tar, and then using the long-handled loggerhead, they proceeded to hurl the hot liquid onto the enemy ship when it came within range. When the two ships were close, sailors on both sides fought using the loggerheads as weapons.
What is the difference between ‘babble’ and ‘ramble’? 
The two words are used to describe how an individual talks; both are normally used to show disapproval. When someone 'babbles', he talks in an excited manner; he talks continuously and very quickly. As a result, making sense of what he is saying becomes rather difficult. The word also carries with it the sense that what is being said is very silly or foolish. While 'babble' describes the manner in which a person talks, 'ramble', on the other hand, describes the direction of the talk. The word comes from 'romen' meaning 'to walk or go'. In the past, a person who rambled in his travels did not have a particular destination in mind; as a result, he wandered about aimlessly. When you refer to someone's talk as being rambling, what you are suggesting is that it had no direction or aim; the speaker kept jumping from one point to another. As there was no connection between the points being made, it left you rather confused. The word can also be used to refer to one's writing style as well.
The two girls babbled on about their new dress.
Siddharth's rambling talk put everyone to sleep.
How is the word 'fickle' pronounced?
This word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, rhymes with 'pickle', 'tickle' and 'nickel'. It comes from the Old English 'ficol' meaning 'deceitful'. When you say that someone is 'fickle', what you are suggesting is that he is someone who cannot be relied on because he constantly keeps changing his mind about things - his feelings towards you, his opinion about something/someone, etc. These changes occur without reason or warning.
Shravasthi's taste in music is not as fickle as her brother's.
Who do you think the fickle public will vote into power?
Is it okay to say 'You should better sit down'? 
No, it is not. You can either say, 'You had better sit down' or 'You should sit down'. 'Better' is usually preceded by 'had' and not 'should'.

There are several different ways of pronouncing this rather formal word. The first syllable ‘sacch’ is pronounced like the word ‘sack’, and the following vowel sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. Some people rhyme the final syllable ‘rine’ with ‘mine’, ‘dine’ and ‘shine’, while others rhyme it with ‘mean’, ‘dean’ and ‘clean’. The word can be pronounced ‘SACK-e-reen’ or ‘SACK-e-ryne’ — in both cases, the main stress is on the first syllable. It comes from the Greek ‘sakkharon’ meaning ‘sugar’, and in everyday contexts, the word is used to show disapproval. When you say that the movie was saccharine, what you are suggesting is that it was overly sentimental, and that it lacked in sincerity. A ‘saccharine’ smile is a fake smile — one that people put on in order to please others.
I am told that Hemanga enjoys watching movies with saccharine love songs.

What is the difference between ‘nepotism’ and ‘favouritism’?
In both cases, you are showing preferential treatment to a person or a group of people. In the case of ‘favouritism’, you could be showing your support to someone who may or may not be related to you. When we were in school, we often felt that the teacher was showing favouritism towards a certain student — in other words, she gave him special treatment; treated him differently from the way she treated others. Parents are often accused of showing favouritism when it comes to their sons. We are all guilty of showing favouritism. The word, ‘nepotism’, on the other hand, comes from the Latin ‘nepos’ meaning ‘nephew’, and it is mostly used in the context of business and politics. When a politician uses his power in an unfair manner to promote his children or people who are related to him, he is accused of nepotism; it is favouritism based on kinship.
The Chief Minister was accused of nepotism when he appointed his daughter as Deputy Chief Minister.
My maths teacher never showed any favouritism towards anyone.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘spick and span’? 
When you say someone’s house that you visited was ‘spick and span’, what you are suggesting is that the house was very well maintained and very clean; you could not find dirt or dust anywhere. The expression is a shortening of ‘spick and span new’, and it was originally used to refer to things that were brand new. According to the Oxford Advanced Learners’ Dictionary, the word ‘spick’ referred to a new nail — one that had not rusted and was still shiny. The word ‘span’ came from the Old Norse ‘span’ meaning a chip that had recently been cut from a block of wood. With the passage of time, the word ‘spick’ began to refer to a ‘spike-nail’ and ‘span’ to a wooden board. So in the old days, when you talked about a ‘spick and span ship’, you were actually talking about the new nails and the new wooden boards that had been used to build the ship. With the passage of time, however, the expression took on a new meaning — it referred to qualities normally associated with things that were new — tidiness, freshness, and so on.

        text: `Which is correct — ‘nook and cranny’ or ‘nook and corner’?
In India, quite a few people tend to say ‘nook and corner’; native speakers of English, however, say ‘every nook and cranny’. Standard dictionaries label ‘nook and corner’ as Indianism. The word ‘nook’ rhymes with ‘book’ and ‘took’ and ‘cranny’ rhymes with ‘granny’ and ‘Danny’. When you say that you have looked for your book or car keys in every nook and cranny, what you are suggesting is that you have looked for it everywhere — even in the most remote place that you could think of. ‘Nook’ is a corner or a secluded spot that is partially hidden, and ‘cranny’ is normally used to refer to an opening or a narrow hole of some kind in a solid object, like a wall or a rock.
Sheetal looked in every nook and cranny, but she didn’t find the treasure.

What is the meaning of ‘throwback’?
When you say that someone is a ‘throwback’ to an earlier era, what you are suggesting is that everything about him — perhaps his behaviour, beliefs, etc. — reminds you of the way people were a long time ago. Something about the individual makes you think about an earlier period of time. The word can be used with things as well.

Should we include full stops after titles like ‘Mr’ and ‘Dr’?
Whether you choose to use a full stop after titles like ‘Mr’, ‘Mrs’ and ‘Ms’ depends on you. It is a matter of style. Among native speakers of English, the Americans tend to use a full stop after the title; the British, on the other hand, do not. If you choose to add the person’s initials, then you can write, ‘Mrs J Rao’ or ‘Mrs. J. Rao’. Which style you choose to adopt is up to you; you need to be consistent in what you do. When it comes to the abbreviated forms for countries — ‘USA’, ‘UK’, etc. — one can choose to either include or leave out the full stop — both ‘USA’ and ‘U.S.A.’ are acceptable. There is a tendency nowadays to omit the full stop.
How is the word ‘facetious’ pronounced? 
The first vowel and the ‘iou’ in the final syllable sound like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The ‘ce’ is pronounced like the word ‘sea’, and the following ‘t’ is like the ‘sh’ in ‘ship’, ‘sheet’, and ‘shop’. The word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, is pronounced ‘fe-SEE-shes’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘facetus’ meaning ‘witty’. When you are facetious, you end up annoying a lot of people around you; you achieve this by making silly or inappropriate comments about something serious. While those around you are taking the matter at hand very seriously, you do the exact opposite. The comments that you believe are funny are inappropriate and annoying.

This three-syllabled word is mostly used in formal contexts to show disapproval. The first ‘e’ is like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’, while the second sounds like the ‘ee’ in ‘fees’, ‘bees’ and ‘knees’. The second 'g' is pronounced like the ‘j’ in ‘jam’ and ‘juice’, and the final ‘iou’ like the ‘a’ in ‘China’. The word is pronounced ‘ig-REE-jes’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘egrigus’ meaning ‘standing out from the flock’, and was originally used to refer to something or someone that/who was outstanding. In the 16th century, the word took on a completely different meaning — it began to mean what it does today — ‘extremely bad and noticeable’.

What is the difference between ‘plod along’ and ‘plod through’?
The two expressions are normally used to refer to movement. When someone ‘plods along’ or ‘plods through something’, he is moving about slowly; he is walking carefully, in an unhurried manner. Unlike ‘plod along’, the expression ‘plod through’ suggests that the individual is walking through something with some difficulty — for example, it could be mud, snow, tall grass, etc. Both expressions have a figurative meaning as well — they can be used to mean boring. When you say that the professor’s lecture plodded along, what you are suggesting is that the slow pace made it boring — you had the feeling that the lecture would never end! If you had to ‘plod through’ someone’s manuscript, it means you had a tough time going through it — it was a laborious process, one that you found boring.
Every morning I saw Rajeev’s grandmother plodding along to the temple.

What is the meaning and origin of ‘pull the plug on something’? 
When you ‘pull the plug’ on some event, you ensure that it does not take place; you use your authority to put a stop to it — by ordering people not to do it, by cutting off the required funds, etc.
Nandan wanted to open a new restaurant. But he had to pull the plug when the bank refused to lend him the money.
The new Vice-Chancellor pulled the plug on several programmes run by the university.
If someone in a hospital is on life support and you decide to ‘pull the plug on him’, it means you have given the doctors permission to switch off the machine — thus resulting in the death of the individual. No one is really sure about the origin of this expression. The only thing that experts are certain about is that the plug does not refer to the electrical plugs that we are all familiar with today. According to the Oxford Book of Idioms, the plug refers to “an older type of lavatory flush which operated by the pulling out of a plug to empty the contents of the pan into a waste pipe.”

The first syllable is pronounced like the word ‘male’ and the following ‘o’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. One simple way of pronouncing the word is ‘MALE-strem’ with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Dutch ‘maelstrom’ meaning, ‘grinding stream’. When the word was borrowed into English, it was used to refer to a whirlpool. Over a period of time, maelstrom acquired a figurative meaning; nowadays, it is mostly used to refer to any situation where there is a lot of confusion or commotion — in terms of the activities, emotions, and so on. The situation is similar to one where a ship or a person is being sucked into a whirlpool.

What is the meaning and origin of ‘give someone no quarter’?
The expression was first used in the military to mean to show no mercy. In the past, when you informed your enemy before a battle or war, that you would be giving no quarter, what you meant was you would not be taking prisoners. All wounded enemy soldiers left on the battlefield and those caught fleeing would be immediately put to death. You will not be housing the soldiers who have surrendered in a prison and feeding them. Over a period of time, the expression began to be used in everyday contexts to mean to show no pity, to be absolutely ruthless. It is also possible to say ‘receive no quarter’.

What is the difference between ‘bother’ and ‘disturb’?
When you ‘bother’ or ‘disturb’ someone, you are preventing a person from doing something; you are interrupting him or her, and in the process, creating problems. Of the two, ‘bother’ tends to be the more informal, and most dictionaries define it as ‘to annoy’. When you tell someone not to bother you, you are requesting him not to pester or annoy you. You are asking him not to be a nuisance. ‘Disturb’, on the other hand, means ‘to interrupt’. It suggests that you are irritating someone through your interruption. As a result, he or she may choose to stop the activity that he or she had been involved in before the disturbance. Like ‘bother’, you may ‘disturb’ someone either intentionally or accidentally.
Mr. Raj has given strict instructions that he is not to be disturbed.

Is it okay to say, ‘I forgot my phone at home’? 
This sort of sentence is quite common in India, but careful users of the language would use ‘left’ instead of ‘forgot’. When the verb ‘forgot’ is used, we do not generally specify where the object was left behind. For example, it is okay to say, ‘Sheela forgot her phone’, but not ‘Sheela forgot her phone at home’. If you wish to indicate the location, then use ‘left’ and not ‘forgot’. ‘Sheela left her phone at home.’

            text: `How is the word ‘narcissist’ pronounced?
The first syllable rhymes with ‘car’, ‘far’, and ‘par’, and the vowel in the second and third syllable sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘kit‘, ‘bit’ and ‘pit’. One simple way of pronouncing the word is ‘NAR-si-sist’ with the stress on the first syllable. In everyday contexts, the word is used to show disapproval. When you refer to someone as being a ‘narcissist’, what you are suggesting is that he is an ‘I’ specialist; a self-centred individual who thinks no end of himself. The topic of conversation usually revolves around him and his so-called achievements. He believes that those around him admire him as well.

What is the difference between ‘grumble’ and ‘complain’? 
In both cases, you are finding fault with something or someone. Of the two, ‘complain’ is the more neutral. When you ‘complain’ to someone, it suggests that you are rather unhappy about something — this sense of dissatisfaction may be justified or unjustified. It can be about something serious or trivial. One can use different modes of communication to complain — writing and speaking. ‘Grumble’, on the other hand, suggests that you are unhappy or annoyed about something minor; a matter that is unlikely to be taken seriously. Unlike in the case of ‘complain’, one need not always grumble to another person. One can grumble to oneself or one can choose to grumble to the cat or dog that is in the house. The word also suggests that the person is usually ill-tempered.
