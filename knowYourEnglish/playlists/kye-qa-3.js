          text: `What is the difference between ‘semi-monthly’ and ‘bimonthly’?
The word ‘bimonthly’ is rather ambiguous; it has two very different meanings. A magazine that is published twice a month — i.e. every two weeks — can be called a ‘bimonthly’. The term, however, can also be used to refer to a journal or magazine that is published once in two months. Americans, in general, prefer ‘semi-monthly’, and they frequently use the word to mean ‘twice a month’.
We decided that the new publication was going to be a semi-monthly/bimonthly.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘happy as a sandboy’? 
This rather old-fashioned expression is mostly limited to British English; the idiom was quite popular till the 19th century. The original expression was ‘jolly as a sandboy’. When you say that someone is ‘happy as a sandboy’, what you are suggesting is that the individual is extremely happy about something. The idiom has more or less the same meaning as ‘happy as a clam at high tide’. In the old days, the word ‘boy’ was frequently used to refer to a man who did menial work; a male worker of low status. This probably explains why the men who look after cattle and work on ranches are called ‘cowboys’, and why men who work in hotels and carry people’s suitcases are called ‘bellboys’. Several centuries ago, sand was used as a form of floor covering in theatres, bars, houses, etc.; whenever someone spilt something or spit on the floor, the sand absorbed it. Sandboys were hired to spread the sand on the floor and also remove it at regular intervals. Though these individuals were seldom paid in cash, they always remained in excellent spirits — the free drinks that they received ensured they always remained happy.
Ramana was happy as a sandboy when the company promoted him.
He’s happy as a sandboy when his grandchildren play with him.
What is the meaning of ‘moonstruck’?
Many people believe that the moon somehow influences the way human beings behave. There are many stories about how on a full moon night, some people transform into werewolves. When you say that someone is ‘moonstruck’, you are suggesting that the individual is acting in an odd manner — the person is in love and is therefore not himself; he is acting in a crazy or foolish manner.
Don’t pay any attention to Priya. She’s moonstruck.
When the actor stepped out of the club, moonstruck teenagers mobbed him.
How is the word ‘mollycoddle’ pronounced?
The first word rhymes with ‘jolly’, ‘volley’, and ‘poly’. The ‘cod’ in ‘coddle’ rhymes with ‘god’, ‘pod’, and ‘mod’, and the second syllable sounds like the ‘dle’ in ‘middle’ and ‘fiddle’. The word, which is mostly used to show disapproval, is pronounced ‘MO-li cod-el’ with the main stress on the first syllable of ‘molly’. When you mollycoddle your children, you are being overly protective. The word also suggests that you indulge them too much; in other words, you make sure that all their wants and demands are met.
Like any grandmother, she took great delight in mollycoddling her grandchild.
I don’t understand why the government is mollycoddling the power industry.
Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody. Mark Twain`

          text: `How is the word ‘acquiesce’ pronounced?
The first syllable sounds like the ‘ack’ in ‘sack’, ‘pack’ and ‘back’; the following ‘qui’ sounds like the ‘wi’ in ‘wit’, ‘will’ and ‘win’. The final syllable is pronounced like the ‘es’ in ‘yes’, ‘mess’ and ‘chess’. The word is pronounced ‘ak-wi-ES’ with the stress on the third syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘acquiescere’ meaning ‘to become quiet’ or ‘remain at rest’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used in formal contexts to mean to agree to something a person has said. You do what the person tells you to, although very reluctantly. You make no attempt to protest; you remain silent.
The new Vice Chancellor refused to acquiesce to the students’ demands.
All three police officials acquiesced to the Minister’s plans.
Can the word ‘snake’ be used as a verb?
Yes, it can. The word ‘snake’ can be used as a noun and a verb. When used as a verb, it suggests that you are moving like a snake — you are not moving in a straight line, but are twisting and turning quite frequently. Think of the people driving a motorcycle or a scooter through traffic in our country — and you get the picture. The expressions ‘snake around’, ‘snake through’, and so on, are mostly used to suggest that there are many twisting curves. When you say that the road snakes its way through the mountain, what you are suggesting is that it is a winding road with a lot of curves.
There was a long queue to get in. It snaked around the stadium.
What is the meaning of ‘lodestar’?
This word has been in the news ever since the anonymous op-ed against the U.S. President Donald Trump was published in The New York Times. There is speculation that the author could be Vice President Pence because ‘lodestar’ is a word that he frequently uses in his conversations and speeches. The first syllable, by the way, is pronounced the same way as ‘load’. The term ‘lodestar’ was first used to refer to the polestar or the North Star. In the past, sailors used it for navigation. The word ‘lode’ originally meant ‘way’ or ‘course’. Sailors used the lodestar as a reference point to find their way home. Nowadays, the word is used to refer to someone or something that is seen as a model or guide. Like the actual star, this individual guides people; he sets an example for others to follow. The word can be used with things as well; the beliefs that you have which often determine your action can be referred to as your lodestar.
A few people sniggered when the Minister said that serving people had been his lodestar all through his life.
Federer still continues be the lodestar for many tennis enthusiasts.

          text: `What is the difference between ‘populous’ and ‘popular’? 
Both words come from the Latin ‘populus’ meaning ‘people’. Of the two, ‘popular’ is much more frequently used than ‘populous’. When you say that someone is ‘popular’, what you are suggesting is that the person is liked or admired by many people. A restaurant that is ‘popular’ is frequented by many people; a lot of people eat there. ‘Populous’, on the other hand, is mostly used with a place — it could be a country, state, area, etc. When you say that a place is ‘populous’, what you are suggesting is that it is full of people; it is ‘densely populated’. India, for example, has a very big population — it is a populous country.
These types of shoes are popular with teenagers.
I don’t wish to live in a populous metropolitan city after I retire.
By the way, the word ‘pop’ in ‘pop music’ — the kind of music that a lot of people like to listen to — is actually a contraction of ‘popular’.
How is the word ‘emolument’; pronounced? 
The first vowel sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘kit’, while the second is like the ‘o’ in ‘cot’, ‘got’ and ‘hot’. The ‘u’ sounds like the ‘ou’ in ‘could’; and ‘would’ and the final ‘e’ is pronounced like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘i-MOL-yu-ment’; with the stress on the second syllable. Like ‘popular’ and ‘populous’, this word too is of Latin origin. It comes from ‘emolumentum’ meaning ‘profit’ or ‘gain’. In Latin ‘emolere’ means ‘grind out’; the word emolument was first used to refer to the money that people paid the miller for grinding their corn. Nowadays, of course, the word is used to refer to the payment one receives for the work one has done — it could be in the form of cash or something else.
What is the meaning of ‘history sheeter’?
Not all standard dictionaries list the terms ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy sheeter’; those that do include them make it clear that they are examples of Indian English. The terms are used in our country to refer to a person with a criminal record — someone who has been arrested by the police. Native speakers of English refer to the sheet that the police use to list the crimes committed by an individual as ‘rap sheet’. In India, it is called ‘history sheet’. It contains the history of the crimes that the individual has committed or has been accused of committing. The term ‘history sheeter’ and ‘rowdy history sheeter’ were coined to refer to someone who has a criminal record —- someone who has a ‘history sheet’. Native speakers, however, do not refer to someone with a ‘rap sheet’ as a ‘rap sheeter’.
Chances are, the well-known history sheeter, will be our next CM.
The police refused to file an FIR against the rowdy history sheeter.
Which is correct ‘discharge from hospital’ or ‘release from hospital’? 
Dictionaries on collocations suggest that ‘discharge’ is the appropriate word. When you say that someone was released from hospital, it suggests that the authorities forced the individual to stay — much against his will. I suppose this is possible in the case of psychiatric patients. In most cases, people would use ‘discharge’.
A hospital should also have a recovery room adjoining the cashier’s office — Francis Owalsh`
