          text: `What is the meaning of ‘running on fumes’? 
When this rather informal expression is used with a person, what it suggests is that the individual is continuing to work even though he has little or no energy left; he is exhausted, and as a result, is working without any enthusiasm. He is like a vehicle that has more or less run out of petrol. When you say that an organisation is running on fumes, what you mean is that it has used up most its resources; it has very little money left to continue to operate. It is likely to close down soon.
It was obvious to everyone that Federer was running on fumes in the last set.
The company that Sunitha works for has been running on fumes the past six months.
What is the difference between ‘council’ and ‘counsel’?
As far as the pronunciation is concerned, there is no difference; both words have the stress on the first syllable. In terms of meaning, both words refer to the act of giving advice. ‘Council’ is mostly used nowadays as a noun to refer to an appointed group of people who meet, discuss and offer advice on a matter — it could be to an individual or an organisation. In the past, every King had his own council; today, every college has a student council. ‘Counsel’, on the other hand, can be used as a noun and a verb. As a noun, it means ‘advice’ or ‘guidance’, and as a verb, ‘to give advice’. In law, ‘Counsel’ is also used to refer to a lawyer. After all, what is it that a lawyer does? He gives advice.
When it comes to matters of money, I always seek Devi’s counsel.
The teacher counselled me not to waste my time by joining the protest.
The council deliberated over the matter for several hours.
Is it okay to say, “According to my father’s opinion, she’s very bright”?
No, it is not. Usually, ‘according to’ and ‘opinion’ do not go together. You cannot say, “According to my father’s opinion”. If you wish to use ‘according to’, then you will have to say, “According to my father, she’s very bright”. If, on the other hand, you wish to use ‘opinion’, then you will have to say, “In my father’s opinion, she’s very bright”. It is also possible to say, “My father thinks she’s very bright”. Remember, it is always “according to” someone else.

          text: `How is the word ‘mischievous’ pronounced?
          The ‘i’ in the first syllable and the ‘ie’ in the second sound like the ‘i’ in ‘kit’, ‘hit’ and ‘pit’. The ‘ch’ is pronounced like the ‘ch’ in ‘chips’, ‘change’ and ‘cheap’; and the final ‘ou’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word consists of three syllables, and it is pronounced ‘MIS-chi-ves’ with the stress on the first syllable. Someone who takes delight in causing trouble is usually referred to as being ‘mischievous’. The aim, in this case, is to have fun at someone’s expense, not to cause him/her serious problems.
Sunny gave her son a mischievous grin as she handed him his present.
I plan to write a novel about the mischievous antics of my students.
What is the meaning of ‘fall between two stools’?
The expression is mostly limited to British English. There are times when we attempt to multitask — try to do two things at the same time, and fail miserably at both. This inability to achieve your goal is what ‘fall between two stools’ and ‘caught between two stools’ refer to. This is just one of the meanings of the expressions.
You can’t be both their boss and their friend, Shiva. If you try, you’ll get caught between two stools.
I signed up for swimming and tennis. With little time to devote to either, I feel I am falling between two stools.
Is it okay to say, ‘The premises is cleaned every day’?
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘premises’. The ‘em’ in the first syllable rhymes with the ‘em’ in ‘them’, ‘gem’ and ‘hem’, and the two vowels that follow sound like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘chit’. The word is pronounced ‘PRE-mi-siz’ with the stress on the first syllable. The second syllable is not pronounced like the word ‘my’. The word ‘premises’ is a plural noun, and is therefore followed by a plural verb. It is mostly used to refer to the buildings and land owned by an organisation.
The premises are cleaned every day.
You cannot use the phone on school premises.
Please escort these troublemakers off the premises.
What is the difference between ‘loveable’ and ‘lovable’?
There is no difference in meaning between them; the two words can be used interchangeably in all contexts. Both can be used to mean ‘easy to love’. ‘Lovable’ seems to be the preferred spelling nowadays.
The lovable puppy had everyone in splits.
Suchi was such a loveable child.

        text: `What is the meaning of ‘like a deer in the headlights? 
The expression is frequently heard in American English in informal contexts. I understand that when a deer sees the lights of an approaching vehicle, instead of running away, it remains frozen. The lights of the car/truck scare the animal so much that it stands paralysed. Therefore, when you compare someone to a ‘deer in the headlights’, what you are suggesting is that like the animal, the individual is very surprised or frightened; he is so confused that he is incapable of thinking — and is therefore unable to react in that situation. It is also possible to say, ‘like a deer caught in the headlights’.
At the interview, he sat there like a deer caught in the headlights — couldn’t answer a single question.
When she accused me of stealing her watch, instead of shouting at her, I just stood there like a deer in the headlights.
How is the word ‘Samaritan’ pronounced?
There are different ways of pronouncing this word. One way is to pronounce the ‘a’ in the first and final syllable like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The second ‘a’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘fan’, ‘ban’ and ‘tan’, and the following vowel is like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘hit’ and ‘kit’. The word is pronounced ‘se-MA-ri-ten’ with the stress on the second syllable. It was initially used to refer to a person who lived in the district of Samaria in Palestine. Nowadays, the word is mostly found in the expression ‘a good Samaritan’, meaning someone who helps others in their time of need. There is a story in the Bible about a man from Samaria who helps an individual who has been beaten and robbed.
Being a good Samaritan, Venu dropped us off at the bus stop.
Don’t worry. Some good Samaritan will help you with the luggage.
Is it okay to say ‘hit up’? 
Yes, it is. The expression is frequently used in American English in informal contexts. When you ‘hit someone up’ for something, you usually want something from them — most of the time, it is money.
Hema hit up Raju for another ₹20,000.
Chandu, don’t waste your time trying to hit me up for a loan.
Nowadays, the expression has acquired another meaning. When you ‘hit up’ someone, you contact the person - usually by phone.
I’m leaving my number. But don’t hit me up unless it’s an emergency.
Shoba hits me up whenever there’s a problem with her computer.
What is the difference between ‘brat’ and ‘kid’? 
‘Kid’ is the more common of the two words. When you say that someone is a ‘kid’, what you are suggesting is that he is a child or is very young. This individual’s behaviour can be either good or bad. ‘Brat’, on the other hand, is always associated with something negative. When you refer to a small child as being a ‘brat’, what you are suggesting is that the individual behaves horribly; he annoys you. The word is mostly used to show your contempt for the individual. ‘Brat’ comes from the Old English ‘bratta’ meaning ‘coarse cloth’. It was actually used to refer to the bib that a child wore while eating.
Shalini’s kids are well behaved. They are not brats.
Children really brighten up a household. They never turn the lights off. Ralph Bus

The ‘i’ in the first and fourth syllable is pronounced like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘kit’ and ‘sit’. The ‘o’ in the second is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’, and the following ‘mu’ sounds like the ‘mu’ in ‘music’ and ‘mute’. The ‘ca’ is pronounced like the ‘ca’ in ‘car’, ‘cart’ and ‘calm’, and the final ‘do’ rhymes with ‘so’, ‘go’ and ‘no’. The word is pronounced ‘in-ke-myoo-ni-KAA-do’ with the stress on the fifth syllable. It comes from the Spanish ‘incomunicar’ meaning ‘deprive of communication’. When you remain ‘incommunicado’, you do not stay in contact with anyone; you cut off all forms of communication with others. This could be because you yourself have chosen not to stay in touch with others or it could be because someone or something is preventing you from making contact. When a suspected terrorist is arrested, he is usually held incommunicado. The police make sure that he does not make phone calls or talk to others.
During the week-long break, Sandeep didn’t answer the phone. He remained incommunicado.
The terrorists were held incommunicado for over three months in an Army prison.
What is the meaning of ‘drop-dead gorgeous’? 
The expression ‘drop-dead’ is usually used before adjectives in informal contexts to emphasise a particular quality. For example, when you say that someone is ‘drop-dead gorgeous’, what you are suggesting is that the person is extremely or amazingly attractive; she is absolutely stunning. Your heart starts pounding so fast when you see her, you nearly collapse.
Even without her make-up, the ageing superstar looked drop-dead gorgeous.
For the reception, the bride wore a saree that was drop-dead gorgeous.
What is the difference between ‘skirmish’ and ‘fight’?
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘skirmish’. The first syllable is pronounced like the ‘skir’ in ‘skirt’, and the second rhymes with ‘dish’ and ‘fish’. The word is pronounced ‘SKER-mish’ with the stress on the first syllable. A ‘skirmish’ is a minor fight lasting for a short period. This fight could be either physical or verbal — it could be an argument between two people about something. The word is frequently used by the military to refer to a fight that occurs between small groups of enemy soldiers, the fight itself is not serious, and it usually takes place far away from the main scene of action.
No one was injured in the skirmish that ensued between the police and the students.
There was a short skirmish between the couple about which restaurant they should go to.
Is it okay to say, ‘The troops invaded the enemy’?
No, it is not. One can invade a country or a place, but not a person. Of course, one can invade a person’s ‘privacy’, but not the individual himself/herself. When you ‘invade’ a country, you go there in large numbers in order to capture it. When you ‘invade’ someone’s property, you enter it illegally, usually in large numbers, in order to damage it. In the case of the sentence you have given, ‘attack’ would a better word to use. The troops attacked the enemy.

        A lot of people who watched Simona Halep running from one corner of the court to the other during the recent Wimbledon final against Serena Williams must have thought that the little Romanian was ‘playing out of her skin’. The expression is used quite frequently in American English in the context of sports. When you say that someone is playing out of their skin, what you are suggesting is that they are playing brilliantly; they are playing the game with a lot of energy and skill, and their performance is truly outstanding. When someone plays out of their skin, it does not necessarily mean that the person ends up winning — just ask Roger Federer.
Ganesh played out of his skin, but unfortunately lost the match.
Hamsa was truly brilliant. She played out of her skin.
What is the difference between ‘retire’ and ‘hit the hay’?
Both are normally used to mean ‘to go to bed’. The word ‘retire’ is the more formal of the two. When someone who is tired says he is ‘retiring’ for the evening, it suggests that he is going to bed - perhaps immediately. The word can also suggest that one does not wish to be in the company of others; the individual who is ‘retiring’ perhaps wants to be alone in his room doing a bit of reading or writing before actually going to bed.
It’s been a really strenuous day; the President plans to retire early tonight.
Sujatha usually retires after dinner. She spends a couple of hours watching TV before going to bed.
The idiomatic expression ‘hit the hay’, on the other hand, is mostly used in informal contexts to mean, ‘to go bed’.
Rajan had already hit the hay before we arrived.
You look sleepy, Shakul. Why don’t you hit the hay?
In the old days, a poor person usually slept on a sack filled with hay — this was his bed. In order to get a good night’s sleep, people used to ensure that the hay in the sack had been spread evenly. This was achieved by hitting the hay before lying down on it.
What is the meaning of ‘pontificate’?
The first syllable rhymes with ‘con’ and ‘don’, and the final syllable with the words ‘hate’, ‘date’ and ‘gate’. The vowel in the second and third syllable sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘kit’. It is pronounced ‘pon-TI-fi-kate’ with the stress on the second syllable. The word is mostly used nowadays to show disapproval. When someone ‘pontificates’, he speaks in a rather pompous way; he believes that his opinion should be the final opinion about a matter because he knows everything there is to know about the subject. Everyone else’s opinion is wrong. The word can also be used to refer to one’s style of writing.
His son is a crook. Yet the Minister is always pontificating about good parenting.
Is it okay to say, ‘pin drop silence’?
Native speakers of English normally say, ‘you could hear a pin drop’ and not ‘pin drop silence’. The expression is normally used to suggest that there was absolute silence — people were so interested or shocked by what was happening that nobody spoke or said anything.
It was so quiet in the meditation hall that you could hear a pin drop.
When Radha announced she was leaving her husband, you could hear a pin drop.

        text: `What is the difference between ‘mock’ and ‘tease’?
‘Tease’ is the more general of the two words. When you ‘tease’ someone, what you are trying to do is to have fun at the other person’s expense. You may say or do something in order to annoy him. For example, we usually tease a friend about his terrible haircut or about his terrible dress sense. We are having harmless fun at the other person’s expense — it is quite possible that both the teaser and the person being teased enjoy the experience. The word can also be used to suggest that you are deliberately saying things in order to hurt the feelings of the other person. The word ‘mock’ is mostly limited to formal contexts, and the use of the word suggests that the intent in this case is to laugh at and not laugh with the other individual. In this case, you say or do things in order to show your contempt for the person — the intent is to ridicule the individual. Unlike ‘tease’, one can mock an individual by imitating him/her.
Shalini is very sensitive. Please don’t even think about teasing her.
No one was amused when Rishi mocked the Principal’s stutter.
How is the word ‘chic’ pronounced?
The ‘ch’ sounds like the ‘sh’ in ‘sheet’, ‘ship’ and ‘sharp’, and the following ‘ic’ is like the ‘eek’ in ‘cheek’, ‘peek’ and ‘seek’. This word of French origin is pronounced ‘SHEEK’. ‘Chic’ can be used both as a noun and an adjective. When you say that someone is ‘chic’, what you are suggesting is that the person is very stylish; he/she is elegantly fashionable. One can talk about someone’s clothes being chic or about someone’s shoes being ‘chic’. The word suggests that the item in question is expensive.
The Mathurs have bought a chic apartment in Malabar Hills.
I just love your new glasses. They look so chic.
Is it okay to call someone a ‘blockhead’?
If the person in question is very stupid, then you certainly can. Should you call the person a blockhead to his face...well, I leave that to you. The word is mostly limited to informal contexts; though many people consider it to be rather old fashioned, it continues to be used even today — other words that have more or less the same meaning are ‘dunce’, ‘knucklehead’ and ‘bonehead’.
Sushma is marrying Kedar? What does that girl see in that blockhead?
Keep the language simple. I want to make sure that the blockheads in the Sales
Department can make sense of the document.
The word has an interesting origin. In the old days in Europe, it was common practice for both men and women to wear wigs — whether you had hair or not, it was fashionable to sport a wig. Rich people, of course, had many wigs. At night-time, the wig was placed on a block of wood that was shaped like the wig wearer’s head — this was to ensure that the wig did not lose its shape. This block of wood was called a ‘blockhead’. With the passage of time, the word began to mean someone who had nothing inside his head — just like the original blockhead.

        text: `How is the word ‘fracas’ pronounced?
The pronunciation of the word seems to depend on which side of the Atlantic you are from — the British and the Americans pronounce the word very differently. According to most standard dictionaries, people in Britain rhyme the first syllable with the words ‘crack’, ‘track’ and ‘rack’. The following vowel sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘path’, ‘bath’, and ‘ask’; the final ‘s’ remains silent. They pronounce the word ‘FRA-kaa’ with the stress on the first syllable.
Many Americans, on the other hand, rhyme the first syllable with the words ‘pray’, ‘tray’ and ‘bray’; some, however, pronounce the first syllable the way the English do. They all pronounce the final ‘s’ and the vowel in the second syllable like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word can be pronounced ‘FRAY-kes’ or ‘FRA-kes’ with the stress on the first syllable.
It comes from the Italian ‘fracasso’ meaning ‘uproar, crash’. The word is mostly used nowadays to refer to a noisy argument or scuffle of any kind — one in which several people are involved. A ‘fracas’ usually lasts for a short time. Two people having a loud argument would not be considered a fracas.
Two policemen were injured when they tried to break up the fracas outside the stadium.
Most teachers and students joined the fracas over the proposed changes in rules.
What is the meaning of ‘punch the ticket’?
This is an expression that is mostly used in informal contexts in American English. The ticket originally referred to a train or bus ticket. In the past, whenever someone bought a ticket, the conductor ‘punched’ or put a hole it. This allowed the passenger to get on with his journey, and also ensured that the ticket was not used again.
The expression ‘punch the ticket’ is used nowadays to mean several different things. Just as a ‘punch’ in the ticket allowed the passenger to continue his journey, the expression ‘punch the ticket’ is used in everyday contexts to mean, “to perform an action that allows one to proceed”. The expression is frequently used in the context of sports — when someone ‘punches his ticket’, he moves to the next round in a tournament. When someone says, “Federer punched his ticket to the final,” what they mean is that Federer won his semi-final match and has advanced to the final.
I don’t think she’ll punch her ticket to the final — she has to play Halep in the next round.
Nobody expected Lisa to punch her ticket to the championship.
The expression has a completely different meaning as well. It can also be used to mean to kill someone.
Govind had his ticket punched by a rival gang member.
If you continue publishing such stories, I’ll send a couple of my men and punch your ticket.

This is a word that is mostly restricted to formal contexts. The ‘e’ in the first syllable and the ‘i’ in the third sound like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘knit’. The second syllable is pronounced like the word ‘may’, and the ‘c’ that follows sounds like the ‘s’ in ‘see’, ‘sit’ and ‘sin’. The last syllable sounds like the word ‘ate’. The word is pronounced ‘i-MAY-si-ate’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘emaciatus’ meaning ‘make lean, to waste away’. When you say someone looks ‘emaciated’, what you are suggesting is that the individual looks extremely skinny; perhaps, dangerously so. There is no energy about him; he is so skinny, that one can count the bones in the body. When there is famine in some part of the world, newspapers and magazines usually carry photographs of emaciated people - people who are nothing more than skin and bones. This look is often the result of malnourishment or illness. Nowadays, of course, there are people who want to promote this kind of look — just look at our so-called supermodels.
She had become so emaciated that no one recognised her.
Jai had a difficult time trying to make eye contact with the emaciated refugees.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘a sop to Cerberus’?
The first syllable of ‘Cerberus’ is pronounced like the word ‘sir’; the vowels in the second and third syllables sound like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘SIR-be-res’ with the stress on the first syllable. ‘Sop’, which rhymes with ‘hop’ and ‘pop’, is usually defined as something insignificant given to someone in order to keep them happy/content. It is also used to refer to piece of bread dipped in something — soup, milk, gravy, and so on. The expression ‘a sop to Cerberus’ has its origins in Greek mythology. Cerberus was a dog with several heads that guarded the gate to Hades — nobody is really sure how many heads the animal had; it varies between three and fifty. In order to enter Hades, one had to give the animal a bribe of some kind — usually, a piece of cake dipped in honey. In the past, it was common practice among the Greeks and Romans to bury their dead along with a piece of honey cake — this was to ensure that Cerberus allowed the dead person into Hades. When you give ‘a sop to Cerberus’, what you are essentially doing is giving them a bribe. Did you know the word ‘bribe’ meaning ‘gift’ at one time referred to the small pieces of bread that people used to carry to give beggars?
Which is correct: ‘to hit someone with something’ or ‘to hit someone for something’?
Both are acceptable. The first expression suggests that you are using an object to hit someone — it could be a gun, a hammer, and so on. When you ‘hit someone for something’, you want them to do you a favour. Maybe you want the person to lend you some money or something else. It is also possible to say, ‘to hit someone up for something’. The expression is mostly used in informal contexts.

The first word is pronounced like the word ‘key’; the second, rhymes with ‘leave’, ‘weave’ and ‘heave’. It is pronounced ‘key VEEV’ with the stress on the second word. In the past, whenever a stranger approached a French fort, the sentry on duty would shout the question “qui vive”, meaning “Long live who”? The expression was the short form of “qui voulez vous qui vive”, meaning “Whom do you wish to live?” The question was used to determine if the person at the gate was a friend or a foe. If the stranger responded by saying, “Long live the King”, he was usually allowed to enter the fort. When this French expression was adopted into English, it took on a totally different meaning. The English were so impressed by how vigilant the French sentry was, they began to use the expression “on the qui vive” to mean “to be alert”, “to be on the lookout”.
Soldiers along the border have been on qui vive since last night’s bombing.
I must tell Veda about the sale at the mall. She’s always on the qui vive for great bargains.
What is the difference between ‘no doubt’ and ‘without doubt’?
The difference is one of emphasis; ‘without doubt’ is the more formal of the two. It has the same meaning as ‘without a doubt’. When you say, “You’ll no doubt go trekking in the morning”, what you are suggesting is that you are pretty sure that the person will go on a trek. In other words, you believe that the person is very likely to go — there is, however, a small element of doubt. When you say, “Dilip without (a) doubt is the most intelligent boy in class”, what you are suggesting is that you have no doubt whatsoever that he is the smartest boy in class. You are absolutely certain about this; ‘without (a) doubt’ adds emphasis to your belief.
Karthik has no doubt told you that he’s getting married next month.
She is without (a) doubt the girl of Karthik’s dreams.
What is the meaning of ‘hardcore’ in ‘hardcore drug addict’? 
The word ‘hardcore’ or ‘hard-core’ can be used both as a noun and an adjective. When you describe someone as being a ‘hardcore addict’, what you are suggesting is that he is into drugs big time; he uses substances regularly, perhaps even on a daily basis. There is little one can do to help him kick the habit. The word is also frequently used to refer to one’s belief system. When you say that someone is a ‘hardcore conservative’, you are implying he is someone who strongly believes in conservatism; nothing you do or say will get him to change his existing set of beliefs. He is someone who is very dedicated to the cause he believes in.

Is it okay to say, “You needn’t to sing”?
‘Needn’t’ is not usually followed by ‘to’. For example, ‘You needn’t sing at the event’. ‘You needn’t do your assignment now’. If you wish to use ‘to’, then you will have to say, “You don’t need to sing at the event”, and, “You don’t need to do your assignment now”.

Most of us are familiar with the word ‘postpone’; it is the more common of the two. When you ‘postpone’ doing something, you delay doing it. You put it off to another day or another time. A meeting scheduled to be held on Monday may be postponed to Thursday. Postponing a meeting usually happens before the meeting actually takes place. It could be a few hours or a few days before the scheduled time. The word ‘adjourn’ brings to mind the Parliament sessions in our country. When you ‘adjourn’ a meeting, you are bringing it to a close temporarily; you are making it clear to everyone that the meeting will resume at a later time or on a later date. Unlike in the case of ‘postpone’, the meeting has already begun; it is not possible to adjourn something before it has begun. As for the pronunciation of ‘adjourn’, the first vowel sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘China’, and the following ‘dj’ sounds like the ‘j’ in ‘jam’, ‘juice’ and ‘jump’. The final ‘ourn’ rhymes with the ‘urn’ in ‘burn’, ‘turn’ and ‘churn’. This rather formal word is pronounced ‘e-JURN’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the French phrase ‘a journ’ meaning ‘to another day’.
The wedding had to be postponed because of the groom’s serious illness.
With the members becoming restless, the CEO decided to adjourn the meeting.
How is the word ‘elite’ pronounced?

What is the meaning and origin of ‘not playing with a full deck’?
The expression is mostly used to show disapproval in American English, and its use is limited to informal contexts. When you say that someone is ‘not playing with a full deck’, what you are suggesting is that the person is not bright; he is, in fact, rather dull or stupid. The expression can also suggest that the person in question is not mentally sound — in everyday language, he is ‘crazy’. The deck in the expression refers to a deck of playing cards. The person is being compared to a deck that does not contain the 52 cards that are required to play any game — something is missing in both the person and the pack of cards.
