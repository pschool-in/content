This American expression is mostly used in informal contexts to mean ‘to be humiliated’. When you are made to eat crow, you are forced to admit that you are in the wrong, and are compelled to take back the comments you had made. It has the same meaning as ‘to eat humble pie’.

Scholars believe that the expression is based on a true incident. A British officer captured an American hunter who had just shot a crow. In order to humiliate him, the Englishman ordered the American to eat a small portion of the bird. The officer then returned the gun and the bird to the hunter and told him to be on his way. The American humiliated the officer by turning the gun on him and making him eat the rest of the crow.

Why is the movie industry referred to as the ‘silver screen’?
For over a century now, the expression ‘silver screen’ has been used to refer to the film industry. The reason for this is during the early decades of the twentieth century, the screens in theatres were coated with metallic paint that had some silver content. This screen was called the ‘silver lenticular screen’ — it was later reduced to ‘silver screen’. With the passage of time, the expression began to be used to refer to the film world, in general. Although theatres have stopped using the ‘silver lenticular screen’, the term ‘silver screen’ continues to be used to refer to the film world.

Is it okay to say ‘It is a reputed school’?
Yes, it is. In this case, what you are suggesting is that people in general say that it is a good school. You yourself, however, have no knowledge whether it is a good school or not. ‘Reputed’ carries with it an element of doubt. If, on the other hand, you are certain that the school is a good one — either because you are a product of the school or know someone who has studied there - you should say it is a ‘reputable school’. Indians, in general, tend to say ‘reputed’ when they mean ‘reputable’.

What is the difference between ‘put someone out’ and ‘put someone off’?

What is the meaning and origin of ‘fall for something hook, line, and sinker’?
The expression comes from the world of fishing. The ‘line’ in the expression refers to the ‘cord’ or ‘fishing line’ that a person uses to catch fish. The ‘hook’ is what the bait (usually a worm) is tied to before the line is dropped into the ocean or river. To ensure that the line with the bait does not merely float on the surface of the water, a sinker (usually a lead weight) is attached. The sinker drags the line and the hook into the water. A hungry fish that swallows the bait ‘hook, line and sinker’ swallows everything. Therefore, when you say that someone fell for your story hook, line, and sinker, what you are suggesting is that he believed you completely; the person was very gullible. The idiom is mostly used with people who are naive; someone who is willing to believe anything others tell him no matter, how crazy it sounds.
