          text: `What is the meaning and origin of ‘to eat crow’? 
This American expression is mostly used in informal contexts to mean ‘to be humiliated’. When you are made to eat crow, you are forced to admit that you are in the wrong, and are compelled to take back the comments you had made. It has the same meaning as ‘to eat humble pie’.
The experts were made to eat crow when the home team lost on the third day.
Ranjit knows that if his plan fails, he will be made to eat crow.
Scholars believe that the expression is based on a true incident. A British officer captured an American hunter who had just shot a crow. In order to humiliate him, the Englishman ordered the American to eat a small portion of the bird. The officer then returned the gun and the bird to the hunter and told him to be on his way. The American humiliated the officer by turning the gun on him and making him eat the rest of the crow.
How is the word ‘erudite’ pronounced?
The first vowel is like the ‘e’ in ‘set’ and ‘bet’, and the following ‘u’ like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The final syllable rhymes with ‘right’, ‘kite’ and ‘might’. One simple way of pronouncing this formal word is ‘E-re-dite’ with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘eruditis’ meaning ‘learned’ or ‘well informed’. Nowadays, the word is used to mean ‘scholar’, someone who is very knowledgeable.
As expected, the professor’s talk was erudite.
Shilpa’s erudite friends talk about things that I have no interest in.
Why is the movie industry referred to as the ‘silver screen’?
For over a century now, the expression ‘silver screen’ has been used to refer to the film industry. The reason for this is during the early decades of the twentieth century, the screens in theatres were coated with metallic paint that had some silver content. This screen was called the ‘silver lenticular screen’ — it was later reduced to ‘silver screen’. With the passage of time, the expression began to be used to refer to the film world, in general. Although theatres have stopped using the ‘silver lenticular screen’, the term ‘silver screen’ continues to be used to refer to the film world.
Several stars of the silver screen joined the student protestors.
Is it okay to say ‘It is a reputed school’?
Yes, it is. In this case, what you are suggesting is that people in general say that it is a good school. You yourself, however, have no knowledge whether it is a good school or not. ‘Reputed’ carries with it an element of doubt. If, on the other hand, you are certain that the school is a good one — either because you are a product of the school or know someone who has studied there - you should say it is a ‘reputable school’. Indians, in general, tend to say ‘reputed’ when they mean ‘reputable’.

The first syllable is pronounced like the word ‘for’, and the following ‘tu’ rhymes with ‘due’, ‘few’ and ‘cue’. The ‘i’ is like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’, and the final ‘ou’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word, mostly used in formal contexts, is pronounced ‘for-TYUU-i-tes’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘fortuitous’ meaning ‘happening by chance; accidental’. Nowadays, the word is mostly used to suggest that the happy turn of events that resulted was unplanned. It carries with it the sense of being ‘lucky’. ‘Fortuitous’ is related to the word ‘fortune’.
The goal that Veda scored in the dying seconds was a fortuitous one.
What is the difference between ‘put someone out’ and ‘put someone off’?
Both expressions have several different meanings. When you ‘put someone out’, you do/say something to annoy or upset a person. The expression is also used in everyday contexts to mean to inconvenience oneself or someone else.
Sonba felt put out when his friends went to the cinema without him.
Padma put herself out in order to make sure her friend was comfortable.
If you are ‘put off by someone’s singing’, you are repelled by it; you hate the way the person sings. The expression ‘put someone off’ is frequently used in informal contexts to mean to dislike something. It can also be used to mean to delay or postpone meeting someone.
Chethan has a tendency to put off people with his loud voice.
I had to put off the broker again. He’s really keen on showing us the model flat.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘fall for something hook, line, and sinker’?
The expression comes from the world of fishing. The ‘line’ in the expression refers to the ‘cord’ or ‘fishing line’ that a person uses to catch fish. The ‘hook’ is what the bait (usually a worm) is tied to before the line is dropped into the ocean or river. To ensure that the line with the bait does not merely float on the surface of the water, a sinker (usually a lead weight) is attached. The sinker drags the line and the hook into the water. A hungry fish that swallows the bait ‘hook, line and sinker’ swallows everything. Therefore, when you say that someone fell for your story hook, line, and sinker, what you are suggesting is that he believed you completely; the person was very gullible. The idiom is mostly used with people who are naive; someone who is willing to believe anything others tell him no matter, how crazy it sounds.
You’re crazy to expect people to fall for that story hook, line, and sinker.
The teacher bought the student’s excuse hook, line, and sinker.
Is it okay to say, ‘Needless to say that Shyam was delighted to see his friend’? 
No, it is not. The expression ‘needless to say’ is not usually followed by ‘that’.
Needless to say, Shyam was delighted to see his friend.
Needless to say, my father wasn’t very happy with my marks.
Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days. — Benjamin Franklin`

          text: `Is the word ‘topper’ used only by Indians?
No, it isn’t. The word ‘topper’ is listed in all standard dictionaries, but the meaning that we Indians have given the word is not included in many of them. In our country, a ‘topper’ is someone who gets the highest marks in a test/exam; a person who comes first in a competition is also referred to as a ‘topper’. Dictionaries that include these meanings of ‘topper’ maintain that it is ‘Indian’.
Chandrika says that she’s been a topper all her life.
In the half-yearly exam, Bharat was the topper.
For a native speaker of English, however, ‘topper’ has a completely different meaning. It is sometimes used to refer to a person who is well liked by those around him. ‘Topper’ is also used to refer to a machine that ‘cuts off the top of weeds’.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘circle the wagon’?
It is mostly used in informal contexts in American English.
The expression ‘circle the wagons’ — not ‘wagon’ — has several different meanings; but its primary meaning seems to be ‘to unite in defence’. When you ‘circle the wagons’, you prepare yourself from an imminent attack; you and those around you unite in an attempt to defend what is or what you consider to be yours.
When the media attacked the Minister, party members started circling the wagons.
Raj wants to open a bar very close to a school. I think the parents need to work together to circle the wagons.
In the past, when families had to travel long distances, they usually did so in wagons. As there was safety in numbers, several families usually came together before they ventured into hostile territory. They ensured that the people and the wagons they were travelling in stayed close together.
Whenever Native Americans attacked the travellers, all the wagons were brought together to create a circle; settlers believed that this circular formation gave them a better chance of protecting themselves against their attackers. According to one story, 32 soldiers succeeded in fighting off a thousand Native Americans using this formation.
How is the word ‘cacography’ pronounced? 
The ‘a’ in the first and third syllables sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’, and the ‘cog’ in the second rhymes with ‘fog’, ‘dog’ and ‘jog’. The word is pronounced ‘ke-KOG-re-fi’ with the stress on the second syllable.
It comes from the Greek ‘cacos’ meaning ‘bad’ or ‘ill’ and ‘graphy’ meaning ‘writing’.
The word literally means bad writing. The use of this word is considered old fashioned; it is used to refer to someone’s bad handwriting or bad spelling.
The teacher said that I lost marks because of my cacography.
Is it wrong to say ‘enclosed herewith’? 
No, it is not. The expression is usually found in letters written by job applicants — not just in our country, but all over the English-speaking world. Careful users of the language, however, object to the use of ‘herewith’. They contend ‘enclosed’ is enough.
I am enclosing (herewith) a cheque for ₹1,000 along with the documents.
We are (herewith) enclosing a copy of the contract.

The first syllable rhymes with ‘so’, ‘no’ and ‘go’, and the second with ‘cot’, ‘got’ and ‘hot’. One simple way of pronouncing the word is ‘ROW-bot’ with the stress on the first syllable. Americans tend to pronounce the second vowel like the ‘ar’ in ‘park’ and ‘dark’. They pronounce the word ‘ROW-baat’. We know that a robot is a machine that is capable of performing complex tasks. When you refer to a person as being a robot, what you are suggesting is that the individual shows little or no emotion.
Some of our former champions played like robots — highly skilled, but rarely displayed any emotion on the tennis court.
Karel Capek, a Czech playwright, coined the word in his play ‘R.U.R (Rossum’s Universal Robots)’. In Czech, ‘robota’ means ‘forced labour’.
What is the meaning of ‘beef up’?
Given the present political climate, perhaps this is an expression that is best left alone! This phrasal verb, which can be used with people and things, has several different meanings. When you beef up security at the airport, for example, you increase it. When you say that your friend has beefed up, what you are suggesting is that he has put on weight and become stronger. It can also be used to mean ‘to make something more interesting’. The expression is mostly limited to informal contexts.
If you want to publish this paper, you need to beef up the section on literature review.
If Dev wants people to vote for him, he must do something to beef up his image.
Is it correct to say, ‘He informed about his promotion to me’? 
No, it isn’t. You don’t ‘inform about something to someone’; you usually ‘inform someone about something’. In this case, the correct sentence would be, ‘He informed me about his promotion’.
The children informed their parents about their plans for the weekend.
I would like to inform you about the meeting I had with the Minister.
What is the meaning of ‘dog days’?
‘Dog days’ is a translation of the Latin ‘caniculares dies’. The term was coined by the Romans to refer to the hottest days of summer — which in Italy was usually in the months of July and August.
The hottest days were referred to as ‘dog days’ because during this period, Sirius — also known as the ‘Dog Star’ — rose along with the Sun. The ancient Romans believed that it was this star that caused the temperature to rise.
During the dog days of summer, there is an acute shortage of power and water. The expression has acquired an additional meaning as well. Nowadays, the term is used to refer to a period of inactivity; a period when you are unsuccessful in everything you do.
Many movie theatres across the country failed to survive the dog days of the 1990s. Some were converted to shopping malls.
Let’s not kid ourselves here, robots already run most of our world. We’ll be their butlers soon enough. — Eric Stoltz`

        text: `What is the difference between a ‘chunky individual’ and a ‘fat individual’?
Both words are used to refer to someone who is or looks overweight. ‘Fat’ is the more common of the two, and it is usually used to refer to someone who is extremely overweight. The height of this individual may vary — he may be tall, short or of medium height. The word is usually used to show disapproval; when you say that someone is ‘fat’, you are suggesting that he presents an unpleasant sight. One does not usually call someone ‘fat’ to his face; it would be considered impolite to do so. ‘Chunky’, on the other hand, is normally used to refer to someone who is short and muscular. Being short and broad shouldered, he looks heavy. Unlike ‘fat’, ‘chunky’ does not have a negative connotation. In fact, according to some books on usage, native speakers sometimes use the word to indicate affection. ‘Chunk’ rhymes with ‘skunk’, ‘punk’ and ‘bunk’.
Priya’s music teacher is chunky. He is definitely not fat.
I saw Raju walking with a chunky girl. Any idea who she is?
How is the word ‘farrago’ pronounced?
The first ‘a’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’ and the second sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘ask’, ‘task’ and ‘mask’. The final syllable is pronounced like the word ‘go’. This rather formal word is pronounced ‘fe-RAA-go’ with the stress on the second syllable. A few weeks ago, many people in our country were talking about this word thanks to Shashi Tharoor’s tweet. When a news channel did an expose on him, Tharoor wrote: “Exasperating farrago of distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies...” The word ‘farrago’ is normally used with things to show disapproval. When you say that an article is a farrago of lies and half-truths, you are suggesting it is an odd or even confusing mixture of the two. Nowadays, the word is used to suggest ‘assortment’ or ‘medley’ — things put together in a haphazard manner.
As expected, the Minister told the police a farrago of lies.
The word comes from the Latin ‘far’ meaning ‘grain’; the word was originally used to refer to ‘fixed fodder’— mixture of grains used to feed cattle. Strange isn’t it? Two tweets from Tharoor that received considerable attention were related to cattle — ‘cattle class’ and ‘farrago’.
What is the meaning of ‘throw someone under the bus’?
This is an expression frequently used in American English in informal contexts. When you throw your friend under the bus, you betray him; in order to save yourself from the trouble you are in, you sacrifice him.
Be careful. Rajiv will throw you under the bus when you stop being useful to him.
The media have accused President Trump of throwing several of his top advisers under the bus.
Is it okay to say, ‘Sajid wrote Anita a cheque of two lakhs’?
No, it isn’t. One usually writes a ‘cheque for’ a certain amount of money. Similarly, one writes a cheque ‘for’ someone.
The CEO of our company was willing to write a cheque for 20 lakhs.

When you refer to someone as being ‘larger than life’, what you are suggesting is that you are drawn to the individual because of his strong personality; everything about him - his behaviour, his appearance, his confidence, the manner in which he speaks, etc. - suggests that he is someone very special. People, in general, find the person so interesting that all those around him pale into insignificance. 
During their playing days, Viv Richards and Ian Botham were larger than life characters both on and off the cricket field.
She made a name for herself in Bollywood playing larger than life characters. In real life, however, the star was very shy and reserved.
How is the word ‘privacy’ pronounced? 
There are two different ways of pronouncing the word. Americans tend to rhyme the first syllable ‘pri’ with the words ‘try’, ‘dry’ and ‘fry’. They pronounce the word ‘PRY-ve-si’ with the stress on the first syllable. The British, on the other hand, pronounce the vowel in the first syllable like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit’ and ‘kit’. They pronounce the word ‘PRI-ve-si’. Privacy is the individual’s right/desire to do things without having others poking their nose into his business - to keep his personal life free from public attention. This is just one of the meanings of the word.
I don’t think the media have the right to invade someone’s privacy.
Sneha has to share her room with her two sisters. She complains that she never gets any privacy.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘a new broom’? 
The ‘broom’ in the expression refers to a person with authority who has joined a new organisation. Being new, he wishes to or is expected to bring about major changes in how the organisation is run. The expression is a shortened form of ‘a new broom sweeps clean’.
Ravi has been the principal for many years now. I think it’s time we hired a new broom.
Frankly, our new broom is not solving problems. He is merely adding to them.
Why do we say ‘pregnant silence/pause’?
When you say that someone is pregnant, we usually understand it to mean that the woman in question is going to have a baby. She is, as some dictionaries put it, ‘with child’. This meaning of pregnant, however, was not the original meaning of the word. When it was first used in English, ‘pregnant’ meant ‘full of significance’. Therefore, when you talk about a ‘pregnant pause’, what you are suggesting is that it was a very significant or meaningful pause; one that made you wonder what the speaker was going to say next. The pause or the silence heightened your anticipation of what was to come next. Stand-up comedians use the pregnant pause/silence to great effect in their routine - they usually pause before delivering the punch line.
There was a pregnant silence before Chanchala screamed the name of the winner.
There was a pregnant pause before she finally said ‘Yes’.
A new broom sweeps clean, but an old broom knows the corners. — Irish Proverb`

First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘kryptonite’. The first syllable rhymes with ‘trip’ and ‘grip’, and the final ‘nite’ is pronounced like the word ‘night’. The vowel in the second syllable is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘KRIP-te-night’ with the stress on the first syllable.
People who have read the comic books or watched the movies featuring the exploits of Superman know that he was born on Krypton. When the planet exploded, kryptonite or the radioactive material from it, was hurled into space. Superman’s enemies discovered that kryptonite was the only thing that could be used to either hurt or kill him. In everyday contexts, the word ‘kryptonite’ is used to refer to someone’s weakness or something that can be used to hurt someone who is strong. It has more or less the same meaning as ‘Achilles heel’.
Many tennis buffs believe that Nadal is Federer’s kryptonite.
When I was in school, Hindi was my kryptonite.
What is the difference between ‘tease’ and ‘taunt’?
When you ‘taunt’ someone, you say nasty or cruel things to an individual to upset or annoy him. The word has a negative connotation; the aim, in this case, is to hurt the feelings of the person intentionally. You do not laugh with him, but at him. ‘Tease’, on the other hand, suggests you are having fun. When you ‘tease’ someone, the aim is not always to hurt someone’s feelings. We often tease people that we are genuinely fond of. Husbands and wives, for example, enjoy teasing each other. Like ‘taunt’, ‘tease’ can also be used to mean to provoke or irritate someone intentionally.
The children teased their father about his absentmindedness.
The players always taunted Aravind whenever he walked out to bat.
What is the meaning and origin of ‘blue blood’? 
When you say ‘Tiger Pataudi had blue blood running in his veins’, what you mean is that he was a person of noble birth; he came from a royal family.
Our city’s blue bloods live in this area.
The expression ‘blue blood’ is a translation of the Spanish ‘sangre azul’. For well over seven centuries (700 -1400), the Moors — people from the nomadic tribes in North Africa — ruled over much of Spain. The invaders were dark complexioned and during the seven centuries they ruled, interracial marriages were common. The aristocrats who lived in Castile, however, refused to have anything to do with the Moors; they did not allow their children to marry one. As a result, people in this area remained fair complexioned. Soon, they began to distinguish themselves from their rulers and fellow aristocrats by calling themselves “sangre azul”. What they meant by this was that because of their very fair complexion, the veins in their arms looked blue. It was as if blue blood was running through their veins.
We read about people accidentally killing themselves while taking a selfie. Is there a word for this? 
Some people refer to it as ‘selficide’. It is a combination of ‘selfie’ and ‘suicide’. The word has not been listed in any standard dictionary as yet.

First, let us deal with the pronunciation of this word. The vowel in the first syllable sounds like the ‘o’ in ‘hot’, ‘pot’ and ‘got’, and the second syllable is pronounced like the word ‘league’. The word is pronounced ‘KO-liig’ with the stress on the first syllable. Many Indians tend to pronounce the ‘o’ like the ‘a’ in ‘china’ and put the stress on the second syllable. ‘Colleague’ comes from the Latin ‘collega’ meaning ‘partner in office’. Native speakers of English use this word to refer to a co-worker; someone who works with you in an office. If you are in school/college, you refer to your fellow student as your classmate and not your ‘colleague’.

What is the meaning of ‘nip and tuck’?
The expression ‘nip and tuck’ is mostly limited to American English; it has more or less the same meaning as ‘neck and neck’. When you say that a game is nip and tuck, what you are suggesting is that the two teams are evenly matched. It will therefore be difficult to predict which team will win; the game is too close to call.
I can’t say which political party will win. It’s nip and tuck right now.

What is the difference between ‘regret’ and ‘apology’?
Politicians seldom apologise for the wrongs they do. Some of our chappal/sandal wielding leaders, choose not to apologise even after they have beaten someone black and blue. When you ‘apologise’ for something you have done, you admit publicly that you are at fault.
You acknowledge that you are the person who is to blame. Like politicians, companies seldom apologise; if they do, it becomes easier for people to take them to court. When you ‘regret something’ you did, you feel bad or sorry about what happened — you wish that it hadn’t happened. It is, however, not an apology. You are not saying that you are to blame.
Pakistan refuses to apologise for the killing of civilians. It merely regrets the incident.
I deeply regret the statement I made. I’m certainly not going to apologise for it.
Is it okay to say ‘plan ahead’?
We hear it all the time, don’t we? Our parents keep telling us that if we want to succeed in life, we must plan ahead. In terms of grammar there is nothing wrong with the expression.
Some careful users of the language, however, argue that the word ‘ahead’ is redundant — ‘plan’ will do. One always plans for the future. We always ‘plan ahead’; no one ever ‘plans behind’!

In terms of grammar, both ‘speak to’ and ‘speak with’ are acceptable. Careful users of the language, however, maintain there is a subtle distinction in meaning between the two. When you ‘speak with’ or ‘talk with’ someone, it suggests you are having a conversation with the individual — the two of you contribute and keep the conversation going. When you ‘speak to’ or ‘talk to’ someone, you are doing most of the talking. It suggests that it is more of a monologue than a dialogue. Your partner mostly listens; he says little. Not all native speakers of English, however, maintain this subtle distinction between the two. In fact, there is a tendency, nowadays, to use ‘speak to’ and ‘speak with’ interchangeably.

What is the meaning and origin of ‘Nelson’s eye’?
The relatively old idiom ‘turn a Nelson’s/Nelson eye’ has more or less the same meaning as ‘turn a blind eye’ to something or someone. When you turn a Nelson’s eye to a problem, you deliberately choose to ignore it; you may even attempt to convince yourself that the problem does not really exist.
The Government has turned a Nelson’s eye to the growing problem of beggars on the streets.
The teacher chose to turn a Nelson eye when she saw her son cheating.
Horatio Nelson, a brilliant but arrogant officer in the British Navy, was blind in one eye. He was fighting the Dutch in Copenhagen in 1801, when he was ordered by his commanding officer, Admiral Parker, to withdraw. When the sailors on Nelson’s ship saw the signal, they immediately informed him of it. Nelson, instead of following orders, placed his telescope on his blind eye and shouted, “I really do not see the signal”. He then ordered his men to continue fighting; a few hours later, he emerged victorious.
What is the meaning of ‘jingoism’?
Most dictionaries define it as ‘extreme patriotism’. Jingoism is the belief that your country is the best and that it can never do any wrong; it is the other country that is to be blamed for all the existing problems. A ‘jingoist’ is blindly patriotic and tends to promote his beliefs in a very aggressive manner. He is willing to go to war with his neighbouring countries just to prove that his country is better. The word is normally used to show disapproval.
Our leaders are promoting mindless jingoism and not patriotism.
Which is correct: ‘You really ought to help her’ or ‘You ought really to help her’?
Both are acceptable. Books on grammar suggest that in constructions with the modal ‘ought to’, words like ‘really’, ‘always’ and ‘never’ can either precede or follow ‘ought’. ‘You ought really to help her’ would be considered the formal of the two.

The two words have very different meanings. ‘Byword’ is mostly used with people and things to mean a very good or an outstanding example of something. For example, if you say that ‘Sujatha has become a byword for hospitality’, what you are suggesting is that she is a great host — she is very welcoming and makes everyone feel wanted. She is an excellent example of what it means to be hospitable. A catchphrase or a motto that captures the essence of something can also be called ‘byword’. ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ became the byword for Government policy in the 1960s.
My friend’s hotel has become the byword for luxury.
Our family’s byword is ‘Whatever happens, happens for the best’.
‘Buzzword’, on the other hand, is usually used to refer to a word or phrase that suddenly becomes very popular in a certain discipline.

What is the meaning of ‘pull oneself up by one’s bootstraps’? 
This informal expression is frequently heard in American English. When you ‘pull/haul/drag yourself up by your bootstraps’, you come up in life through sheer hard work. You improve your position or status without taking the help of other people. You are a self-made individual.

There are different ways of pronouncing this word. One simple way is to pronounce the first word like the word ‘fate’. The ‘a’ in ‘accompli’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’, and the final ‘i’ sounds like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’ and ‘bit’. The word can be pronounced ‘fate e-KOM-pli’ with the main stress on ‘com’. This French expression literally means ‘an accomplished fact’. When you say that something is a ‘fait accompli’, what it implies is that a decision regarding a certain matter has already been made; there is no point in discussing it because nothing we do or say will matter. The decision taken is final; we have no option but to accept it.
