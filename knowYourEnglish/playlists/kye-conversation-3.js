          text: `“Ever since my mother put my father on a diet, he’s been in a terrible mood. He gets angry about things very quickly. It’s very difficult to understand...”
“I don’t think the poor man is just angry. He’s probably ‘hangry’!”
“Hangry! I’ve never heard that word before. Is it a new word?”
“Believe it or not, it’s been around for nearly 70 years. It’s a combination of ‘hungry’...”
“And ‘angry’, I suppose! Does it refer to the anger that you feel when you’re hungry?”
“Very good. The hunger puts you in a foul mood. Everything irritates or angers you.”
“We’ve all experienced it, I guess. How about this example? Because he’d skipped lunch, Jai was pretty hangry by dinnertime.”
“Sounds good. I could see that Bala was getting hangry. So we went to a restaurant and had a couple of sandwiches and a cup of coffee. He felt much better after that.”
Taking it easy
“Talking about feeling much better, how are you feeling after your trip to Goa?”
“I’m feeling great. I had a wonderful time lolling around the beach, and...”
“Lolling around? Does it mean lying down on the...?”
“When you say that you were ‘lolling around’ or ‘lolling about’, what you’re suggesting is that you were sitting or lying down somewhere. The expression suggests you were relaxed and were really enjoying yourself. For example, my grandmother lolls about in her rocking chair in the mornings.”
“Once I get a job, I’m going to be lolling around all day in my pyjamas on Sundays.”
“Sounds like a plan. When my boss saw some of us having a conversation near the water cooler, he told us to stop lolling about and get back to work.”
“That’s what our Principal does as well. Tell me, how was the conference in Goa?”
“It was a total waste of time and money. If you ask me, I think all conferences should be banned. Nothing ever happens.”
“Why do you say that? Didn’t the delegates at the conference like your paper?”
Sailing through
“Most of the people who came wanted to spend all their time on the beach. So when it came to the paper presentation, most speakers just whizzed through and...”
“What did you say? Whiz through? Does it mean to finish something very quickly?”
“Exactly! When you ‘whiz through’ something, you do it very quickly — without too much trouble. I’d expected the test to be difficult. But I just whizzed through it.”
“How about this example? My mother gave me several things to do this morning. I whizzed through them and then went to see a movie.”
“That’s a good example. And knowing you, that’s all it is — an example. I’m sure you haven’t even started on anything.”
“As usual, you’re right! Like many people you know, I find it difficult to whiz through household chores.”
“Federer whizzed through the first set, and won the second in a tie-breaker.”
“Tell me, do the expressions ‘whiz through’ and ‘waltz through’ mean the same thing?”
“When you ‘waltz through’ something, you finish it quickly because you find it easy to do. For example, most of the students waltzed through the test.”
“Mala had trained so well that she waltzed through the first three rounds of the tournament.”
“Good for her!”

            text: `“I ran into Anjali’s brother yesterday. He said that Anjali and Rahul are getting a divorce. Don’t you find that strange? They’re such a...”
“No, I don’t find it strange at all! I’m happy she’s getting out of that toxic relationship.”
“Toxic relationship? Doesn’t ‘toxic’ mean poisonous or something?”
“Yes, one of the meanings of ‘toxic’ is poisonous. One can talk about ‘toxic waste’, ‘toxic chemicals’, and so on. But the word can also be used to refer to something that is very bad or harmful. Something that causes a lot of unpleasantness and...”
“In other words, something that causes unhappiness.”
“Exactly! And this unhappiness or unpleasantness usually lasts for some time. Ever since the workers went on strike last month, the situation at the office has been toxic.”
“Anjali’s husband doesn’t have too many friends because of his toxic sarcasm.”
In good books
“That’s a good example. Now that he’s divorcing Anjali, he won’t have any friends left. If he wants to keep some of them, he’ll need to be nice to them. Butter them up, if he...”
“Butter them up? What does it mean?”
“It’s an expression mostly used in informal contexts. When you ‘butter someone up’, you flatter them. You do this because you want to...”
“You want something from them. You’re being nice to them because you need a favour.”
“Very good! In schools and colleges, it’s very common to see students trying to butter their teachers up.”
“A little bit of buttering up goes a long way in getting a student a few extra marks.”
“That’s true. If you want to tide over the crisis, you need to butter up all the investors. If you don’t, the company will definitely collapse.”
“You have a point there. But sometimes, it backfires. I tried to butter up my grandfather by cleaning and rearranging his room. Instead of being happy, he became extremely angry. Had a difficult time finding his things.”
“So by trying to butter him up, you succeeded in cheesing him off!”
“First ‘butter’, and now ‘cheese’! Does ‘cheese off’ mean to annoy someone?”
“When you ‘cheese someone off’, you make the person very angry or irritated. Like ‘butter up’, it’s used in informal contexts. My father was really cheesed off with his boss.”
Annoyed
“Something that the Principal said at the meeting seems to have cheesed most teachers off. How does that example sound?”
“Good! Two of my best friends are really cheesed off with each other. They are...”
“So, what are you doing to do to bring the fight to an end? What are you doing to help them patch up?”
“Absolutely nothing! I don’t want to get involved, so I’m avoiding them both. I’m keeping my head down.”
“Keeping your head down? Are you doing that because you don’t want to be seen?”
“The expression is mostly used to mean to avoid being seen — to make sure that no one notices you. It can also be used to mean not to get involved in the things happening around you.”
“I see. Radha decided to keep her head down while her two brothers argued about which restaurant they should go to on their parents’ anniversary.”
“I don’t get involved in office politics. I keep my head down and do my job.”
“Sensible thing to do.”

            text: `“Your friend Akash tells me that the man who came to your school yesterday spoke really well. He had some interesting things to say about...”
 “Akash may have liked it. But most of us didn’t. The man used too many jargons.”
“Jargon. The word ‘jargon’ is mostly used...”
“I know what ‘jargon’ means. It refers to the special terms or expressions used in a profession or field. For example, LBW, forward short leg, leg slip, and so on, are jargons used in cricket.”
“That’s right! But what I wanted to say was ‘jargon’ is an uncountable noun. The plural is ‘jargon’ and not ‘jargons’. I don’t understand the jargon of law.”
“I don’t think anyone does. The speaker used too much jargon yesterday. How was the annual party, by the way? Did you have a good time?”
Eventful
“Most of us were having a good time till the Marketing Manager had a major meltdown.”
“A major meltdown? Does it mean he became rather emotional and started crying?”
“It could. The expression ‘meltdown’ is mostly used in informal contexts. When an individual has a ‘meltdown’, he becomes very upset about something.”
“Usually when people get upset, they shout at others.”
“That’s right! A meltdown suggests an emotional outburst of some kind. You could either shout at somebody or break down because...”
“In other words, the person is no longer in control of his emotions. He loses his self-control. Serena had a major meltdown during the recent US Open final.”
“She did, didn’t she? Here’s another example. Taking care of triplets can’t be easy. I’m sure Revathi has a meltdown every now and then.”
“Why don’t you ask her husband? When I was young, my father used to have a major meltdown whenever he saw my report card. Was it the same case with your father?”
“In my case, it was my mother who used to have the meltdown. My father, on the other hand, didn’t really care. He was pretty laid-back.”
Composed
“Laid-back? Does it mean a lazy person? Someone who doesn’t really care about anything?”
“That’s not what it means. A laid-back person is someone who doesn’t get upset about things very easily. He seems very calm and relaxed all the time.”
“In other words, someone who doesn’t let the pressure get to him. Nothing really worries him. My physics teacher has a laid-back approach to everything.”
“I enjoy being in the company of people who are laid-back. When you’re in their company, you begin to relax. The term can be used with things as well. For example, compared to Mumbai, Hyderabad is a very laid-back city.”
“Compared to Mumbai, any city in India would seem laid-back. Raju says that the company that he’s working for now is pretty laid-back. They don’t have a dress code or anything. The only thing they care about is meeting deadlines.”
“Isn’t your uncle coming to your place today?”
“That’s right. He said that he’d be arriving in our place around six in the evening.”
“Arriving ‘at’, not ‘in’. You normally use ‘arrive in’ when you have a city or country in mind. For example, the children arrived in Hyderabad last week.”
“The President will be arriving in Singapore this afternoon.”
“Otherwise, it’s usually ‘arrive at’. We arrived at the airport a little after one.”
“By the time we arrived at the bus stop, the bus had left.”
“That sounds like you. You’re always late for everything.”
Happiness is not a state to arrive at, but a manner of travelling. Margaret Lee Runbeck`
