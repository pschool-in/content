“I don’t think the poor man is just angry. He’s probably ‘hangry’!”
“Hangry! I’ve never heard that word before. Is it a new word?”
“Believe it or not, it’s been around for nearly 70 years. It’s a combination of ‘hungry’...”
“And ‘angry’, I suppose! Does it refer to the anger that you feel when you’re hungry?”
“Very good. The hunger puts you in a foul mood. Everything irritates or angers you.”
“We’ve all experienced it, I guess. How about this example? Because he’d skipped lunch, Jai was pretty hangry by dinnertime.”
“Sounds good. I could see that Bala was getting hangry. So we went to a restaurant and had a couple of sandwiches and a cup of coffee. He felt much better after that.”
Taking it easy
“Talking about feeling much better, how are you feeling after your trip to Goa?”
“I’m feeling great. I had a wonderful time lolling around the beach, and...”
“Lolling around? Does it mean lying down on the...?”
“When you say that you were ‘lolling around’ or ‘lolling about’, what you’re suggesting is that you were sitting or lying down somewhere. The expression suggests you were relaxed and were really enjoying yourself. For example, my grandmother lolls about in her rocking chair in the mornings.”
“Once I get a job, I’m going to be lolling around all day in my pyjamas on Sundays.”
“Sounds like a plan. When my boss saw some of us having a conversation near the water cooler, he told us to stop lolling about and get back to work.”
“That’s what our Principal does as well. Tell me, how was the conference in Goa?”
“It was a total waste of time and money. If you ask me, I think all conferences should be banned. Nothing ever happens.”
“Why do you say that? Didn’t the delegates at the conference like your paper?”
Sailing through
“Most of the people who came wanted to spend all their time on the beach. So when it came to the paper presentation, most speakers just whizzed through and...”
“What did you say? Whiz through? Does it mean to finish something very quickly?”
“Exactly! When you ‘whiz through’ something, you do it very quickly — without too much trouble. I’d expected the test to be difficult. But I just whizzed through it.”
“How about this example? My mother gave me several things to do this morning. I whizzed through them and then went to see a movie.”
“That’s a good example. And knowing you, that’s all it is — an example. I’m sure you haven’t even started on anything.”
“As usual, you’re right! Like many people you know, I find it difficult to whiz through household chores.”
“Federer whizzed through the first set, and won the second in a tie-breaker.”
“Tell me, do the expressions ‘whiz through’ and ‘waltz through’ mean the same thing?”
“When you ‘waltz through’ something, you finish it quickly because you find it easy to do. For example, most of the students waltzed through the test.”
“Mala had trained so well that she waltzed through the first three rounds of the tournament.”
“Good for her!”

“No, I don’t find it strange at all! I’m happy she’s getting out of that toxic relationship.”
“Toxic relationship? Doesn’t ‘toxic’ mean poisonous or something?”
“Yes, one of the meanings of ‘toxic’ is poisonous. One can talk about ‘toxic waste’, ‘toxic chemicals’, and so on. But the word can also be used to refer to something that is very bad or harmful. Something that causes a lot of unpleasantness and...”
“In other words, something that causes unhappiness.”
“Exactly! And this unhappiness or unpleasantness usually lasts for some time. Ever since the workers went on strike last month, the situation at the office has been toxic.”
“Anjali’s husband doesn’t have too many friends because of his toxic sarcasm.”
In good books
“That’s a good example. Now that he’s divorcing Anjali, he won’t have any friends left. If he wants to keep some of them, he’ll need to be nice to them. Butter them up, if he...”
“Butter them up? What does it mean?”
“It’s an expression mostly used in informal contexts. When you ‘butter someone up’, you flatter them. You do this because you want to...”
“You want something from them. You’re being nice to them because you need a favour.”
“Very good! In schools and colleges, it’s very common to see students trying to butter their teachers up.”
“A little bit of buttering up goes a long way in getting a student a few extra marks.”
“That’s true. If you want to tide over the crisis, you need to butter up all the investors. If you don’t, the company will definitely collapse.”
“You have a point there. But sometimes, it backfires. I tried to butter up my grandfather by cleaning and rearranging his room. Instead of being happy, he became extremely angry. Had a difficult time finding his things.”
“So by trying to butter him up, you succeeded in cheesing him off!”
“First ‘butter’, and now ‘cheese’! Does ‘cheese off’ mean to annoy someone?”
“When you ‘cheese someone off’, you make the person very angry or irritated. Like ‘butter up’, it’s used in informal contexts. My father was really cheesed off with his boss.”
Annoyed
“Something that the Principal said at the meeting seems to have cheesed most teachers off. How does that example sound?”
“Good! Two of my best friends are really cheesed off with each other. They are...”
“So, what are you doing to do to bring the fight to an end? What are you doing to help them patch up?”
“Absolutely nothing! I don’t want to get involved, so I’m avoiding them both. I’m keeping my head down.”
“Keeping your head down? Are you doing that because you don’t want to be seen?”
“The expression is mostly used to mean to avoid being seen — to make sure that no one notices you. It can also be used to mean not to get involved in the things happening around you.”
“I see. Radha decided to keep her head down while her two brothers argued about which restaurant they should go to on their parents’ anniversary.”
“I don’t get involved in office politics. I keep my head down and do my job.”
“Sensible thing to do.”

 “Akash may have liked it. But most of us didn’t. The man used too many jargons.”
“Jargon. The word ‘jargon’ is mostly used...”
“I know what ‘jargon’ means. It refers to the special terms or expressions used in a profession or field. For example, LBW, forward short leg, leg slip, and so on, are jargons used in cricket.”
“That’s right! But what I wanted to say was ‘jargon’ is an uncountable noun. The plural is ‘jargon’ and not ‘jargons’. I don’t understand the jargon of law.”
“I don’t think anyone does. The speaker used too much jargon yesterday. How was the annual party, by the way? Did you have a good time?”
Eventful
“Most of us were having a good time till the Marketing Manager had a major meltdown.”
“A major meltdown? Does it mean he became rather emotional and started crying?”
“It could. The expression ‘meltdown’ is mostly used in informal contexts. When an individual has a ‘meltdown’, he becomes very upset about something.”
“Usually when people get upset, they shout at others.”
“That’s right! A meltdown suggests an emotional outburst of some kind. You could either shout at somebody or break down because...”
“In other words, the person is no longer in control of his emotions. He loses his self-control. Serena had a major meltdown during the recent US Open final.”
“She did, didn’t she? Here’s another example. Taking care of triplets can’t be easy. I’m sure Revathi has a meltdown every now and then.”
“Why don’t you ask her husband? When I was young, my father used to have a major meltdown whenever he saw my report card. Was it the same case with your father?”
“In my case, it was my mother who used to have the meltdown. My father, on the other hand, didn’t really care. He was pretty laid-back.”
Composed
“Laid-back? Does it mean a lazy person? Someone who doesn’t really care about anything?”
“That’s not what it means. A laid-back person is someone who doesn’t get upset about things very easily. He seems very calm and relaxed all the time.”
“In other words, someone who doesn’t let the pressure get to him. Nothing really worries him. My physics teacher has a laid-back approach to everything.”
“I enjoy being in the company of people who are laid-back. When you’re in their company, you begin to relax. The term can be used with things as well. For example, compared to Mumbai, Hyderabad is a very laid-back city.”
“Compared to Mumbai, any city in India would seem laid-back. Raju says that the company that he’s working for now is pretty laid-back. They don’t have a dress code or anything. The only thing they care about is meeting deadlines.”
“Isn’t your uncle coming to your place today?”
“That’s right. He said that he’d be arriving in our place around six in the evening.”
“Arriving ‘at’, not ‘in’. You normally use ‘arrive in’ when you have a city or country in mind. For example, the children arrived in Hyderabad last week.”
“The President will be arriving in Singapore this afternoon.”
“Otherwise, it’s usually ‘arrive at’. We arrived at the airport a little after one.”
“By the time we arrived at the bus stop, the bus had left.”

“Yes, several people messaged me. Felt sad because he wasn’t all that old. Well, death comes to all, I suppose. We all have to kick the bucket sometime or the other.”
“Tell me, why does the expression ‘kick the bucket’ mean to die?”
“According to one theory, it is because people used to commit suicide using a bucket.”
“Really? What did they do? Did they put their head in a bucket full of water and...”
“No, no! They used the bucket to hang themselves. You see, they used to turn the bucket upside down and stand on it. After putting the noose around their neck, they would kick the bucket away.”
“But why didn’t they use a chair or a table to hang themselves? Why a bucket?”
“Not everyone owned a chair or a table those days. But no matter how poor you were, you had a bucket. It was the only way to store water. That’s one of the theories, anyway.”
“I see. What are the other theories about the origin of the idiom?”
Informal context
“Will tell you some other time. One thing to remember about the expression is that it is mostly used humorously. You cannot walk up to a person who is grieving and say, ‘I am so sorry to hear your father kicked the bucket last night’. it is likely to offend him and even make him angry.”
“Angry like your friend, Ravi? Heard he was fired yesterday. What did he do this time?”
“Ravi is very good at his work. No one can deny that. But the problem is he constantly keeps shooting his mouth off. Bosses don’t like that.”
“Keeps shooting his mouth off? Does it mean to talk a lot about something?”
“The expression has several meanings. When you shoot your mouth off, you talk about something that you shouldn’t be, and in the process irritate people or make them extremely angry. I can assure you that no one on my team will be shooting their mouth off to the press.”
“Is the expression also used to mean to talk boastfully about something?”
“Yes, it is. The vice-captain has been shooting her mouth off about how the home team is going to destroy the visitors.”
“It’s become part of the game now — every player keeps shooting his mouth off about something or the other.”
“Ravi kept shooting his mouth off about how intelligent he is. He also called his boss a lot of names.”
“That was a silly thing to do! Can’t you do anything to help Ravi?”
“Perhaps if he hadn’t shouted at his boss. But there’s no unringing the bell now.”
“Unringing the bell? What in the world are you talking about?”
“This informal expression is frequently used nowadays to mean what has been said cannot be unsaid. In other words, we cannot take back what we have said.”
“So, what you are saying is when you do or say something, you have to face the consequences. You cannot run away from them. There’s no escaping.”
“Exactly! Once you go to the press with this story, your friends will turn their back on you. There’s no way that you can unring the bell.”
“In her anger, Anu accused her sister of stealing. There’s no unringing the bell now.”
“That’s a good example.”

“Fill you in? Is she going to be giving you a lot of information about the projects?”
“Exactly! When you ‘fill someone in on something’, you give them additional or extra information about it — information which they didn’t have earlier. The dean filled us in on the decisions taken at the Academic Council meeting.”
“In other words, he kept you fully informed of the decisions taken at the meeting. I love talking to my grandmother. She always fills me in on the latest family gossip.”
“Why are you so interested in gossip? Surely, you’ve better things to do. Why...”
“I’m not interested in gossip. No matter what people say about me, I’m not the one...”
A raw nerve
“Take it easy, will you? My remark about you being a gossip seems to have touched a raw nerve. I didn’t mean to...”
“Touched a raw nerve? What are you talking about?”
“When something that you say ‘hits’ or ‘touches a raw nerve’, what you’re doing is making the other individual extremely angry or upset. You have made a comment intentionally or unintentionally about something that the person is rather sensitive about. For example, Sharoon’s remark that Laxman was a better player than Sachin hit a raw nerve with some of her friends.”
“How about this example? Something that my grandmother said during her conversation with my mother must have hit a raw nerve. I have never seen my mother so angry.”
“Good example. It was obvious from everyone’s face that the Principal’s criticism had touched a raw nerve.”
“Did you watch last night’s match? I thought we would win easily, but...”
“We should have won easily, but the fielding was terrible. Our players kept dropping simple catches. We were lucky to end up winning by a nose.”
“Winning by a nose? Does it mean to win a game by a narrow margin?”
“Very good! That is exactly what it means. When you say that someone won the race by a nose, what you are suggesting is that the person just managed to win it. It was close. The expression has the same meaning as ‘by a whisker’.”
“How about this example? The 100-metre dash was really exciting. The two runners were running neck and neck, but Anjali managed to beat Julu by a nose.”

“The expression was used in the military first. When you say you require more boots on the ground, you mean that we need to send more soldiers to take part in an operation or a campaign. The situation calls for more ground troops.”
“So, the expression is used to refer to soldiers actively participating in something?”
Deploy more forces
“I guess you could say that. During the First World War, a soldier was frequently referred to as ‘boot’. Given the tense situation along the LOC, the Minister said that the Government is planning to have more boots on the ground.”
“How about this example? We get hourly updates from the boots on the ground.”
“Sounds good. But nowadays, the expression is being used in non-military contexts as well. It is quite frequently used in politics.”
“That is what I wanted to ask you about. In the article I am reading, the leader of the Opposition says she wants more boots on the ground.”
“In this case, it refers to the workers of the party — people who volunteer their services. In most Western countries, they help out by going from house to house in a particular locality and talk to the people about their candidate. They distribute pamphlets; sometimes, they sit in the party office and call up people.”
“If you are serious about winning, you need to have boots on the ground at least six months before the election.”

“That’s a good example. But did you know that the word buff also refers to a colour? One of the meanings of buff is ‘light brownish yellow’.”
“But what’s the connection between the two meanings? I mean, is there...”
“The word actually comes from the Latin ‘bufalus’ meaning ‘buffalo’. ‘Buff’ was used to refer to the brownish yellow hide of the animal. Centuries later, volunteer fire fighters in New York City began to be called ‘fire buffs’ because they were very enthusiastic about their job — and their uniform was brownish yellow.“

Piecemeal
“Piecemeal? Does it mean doing something little by little with no apparent plan?”
“Exactly! Doing something little by little over a period of time in a rather unsystematic or random manner. Harini was upset because her recommendations had been implemented piecemeal.”
“Over the years, the Government has provided piecemeal solutions to the water problem.”
“That’s because our politicians can’t plan. They can only work piecemeal. So tell me, how was your trip to Kerala? Did you enjoy yourself”
“You bet! Spent a lot of time with little Anika. I enjoyed myself big time.”
“Big time? Is it another way of saying that you enjoyed yourself a great deal?”
“That‘s right! The expression ‘big time’ is mostly used in informal contexts to add emphasis to something that you’ve said.”
“I see. If I say, ‘Vijith is into tennis big time’, it means that he likes tennis very much. He is a tennis buff.”
“Exactly! It could mean that he plays a lot of tennis or that he follows tennis closely.”
“While you were gone, I looked after your plants. So, you owe me big time.”
“Good example. While I was away, people at the office messed things up big time.”
“I see. How are the new tennis shoes you bought? Are they comfortable?”
“I’m sure they will be once I break them in.”
“Break them in? Why would you want to break your shoes? Is it even possible?”
“I’m not going to break them, but break them in. In other words, I’m going to wear the shoes for very short periods of time till I begin to feel comfortable in them.”
“New shoes are usually pretty stiff. So, when you break them in, you’re making them more flexible. You’re making them supple.”
“I guess you could say that. You can use the expression with other things as well.”

“Crown? What crown? What are you talking about?”
“A king usually wears a crown, doesn’t he? Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is a line from Shakespeare’s Henry IV. What it means is that someone with a great deal of responsibility — like a king, for example — is constantly worried about the things he has to do, and therefore seldom sleeps well.”
“As Peter Parker’s uncle says in the Spiderman movie, ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. The more responsibility, the more worries.”
“Exactly! Kishore says that he hasn’t been sleeping well after having been promoted to Dean. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, I guess.”

“Didn’t the company apply pressure on him to accept the post?”

“You know Mahesh. He refused to be cowed into doing anything he didn’t want to.”
“Cowed into doing something? Does it mean bullied into doing something?”

“Birdbrained schemes? Does it mean crazy schemes?”
“When you say that something is a ‘birdbrained scheme’, you mean that it’s a stupid scheme. Our politicians often come up with birdbrained schemes.”
“How about this example? The Minister’s birdbrained answers left the audience wondering how the man managed to get elected.”
“That’s a good example. The word ‘birdbrain’ is frequently used in informal contexts with people as well. My former boss was a real birdbrain.”
“Meaning that he was stupid. Like your boss, my next-door neighbour is a birdbrain too. Was your boss grumpy like my neighbour?”
“Grumpy? Definitely not! If you ask me, he was always in good humour.”
“Good humour? Do you mean to say that your boss cracked a lot of jokes and kept people entertained?”
In good humour
“The expression ‘in good humour’ has nothing to do with one’s sense of humour. When you say that Revathi was in good humour, you mean that she was in a cheerful mood.”
“In other words, you’re talking about the mood of the person and not whether he’s capable of being humourous or not.
Jayanth is always in good humour. I’ve never seen him get upset about anything.”
“Unlike his sister, whenever Kailash’s friends tease him, he takes it all in good humour.”

“Sounds great! Someone said that the movie was a delicious comedy about the world of football.”
“Talking about sports, tell me, which is correct? Is it ‘India win’ or ‘India wins’ the first one day international? In some newspapers, it’s ‘wins’, and in others ‘win’. I’m a bit confused.”
“Actually, both are correct. It all depends on how you view the team. If you think of the team as consisting of several individuals, then you normally use a plural verb — are, have, were, etc. If, on the other hand, you think of the team as being a single unit, then you use a singular verb. For example, Arsenal hasn’t been doing well this season.”
“But I can also say, Arsenal haven’t played to their potential this year.”
“You certainly can. India have/has a good chance of sweeping the one day series.”
“Every time you say something like that, we always end up losing the next match.”
Sports are the reason I am out of shape. I watch them all on TV. — Thomas Sowell`

        text: `“Hey, Happy New Year! Good to see you. When did you get back from your trip?” “Around seven last night. How have you been?”
“Pretty good, actually. So, how was your trip? Where did you go? Did you manage to find a place that was off the beaten track — and the peace and quiet you were looking for?”
“Peace and quiet, no. A couple of my colleagues and I went to a small town about a hundred kilometres from here. We had a blast. The hotel...”
“There was a blast? I didn’t read about any blast in the newspapers. When was this?”
“I said that my friends and I had a blast, meaning that we had a very good time. We went trekking every morning, and in the evening, played cricket with the kids.”
“I see. So, when I say I had a blast, it’s another way of saying that I really enjoyed myself. That I had a really good time!”
“That’s right! It’s an expression mostly limited to informal contexts. Last night, my cousins had a blast going to different parties and sampling different types of food.”
“Your cousins are foodies, I guess. How about this example? The kids had a blast playing with the rabbits and the puppies.”
“Sounds great! Did you have a blast at the party last night?”
“I didn’t go this time! I was feeling extremely tired. Did you?”
“No, I didn’t either. I’ve decided no more New Year parties. People are just keen to show that they can drink me under the table.”
Drink me under
“How can anyone drink you under the table? What are you talking about?”
“When you tell someone that you can drink him under the table, what you’re suggesting is that you can drink more alcohol than him and still remain sober.”
“In other words, you’re challenging the person.”
“That’s right! Most of the people I know can probably drink me under the table.”
“That’s because you don’t have more than one drink when you go to parties. So, how are you feeling after the trip? Tired?”
Right as rain
“I was last night. But after a good night’s sleep, I feel right as rain.”
“Right as rain? Does it mean you’re feeling better now?”
“When you say that you feel right as rain, what you’re suggesting is that you’re feeling perfectly all right. Earlier you weren’t feeling so good.”
“I see. When Jyothi broke her leg, she worried if she’d ever play tennis again. But after a couple of months of rest, followed by intense physiotherapy, she was right as rain.”
“That’s a good example. There’s nothing seriously wrong with the car. Once you change the spark plug and the air filter, she’ll be as right as rain.”
“She? Don’t you mean ‘it’? Does one refer to a car as ‘she’?”
“It’s common among native speakers of English to refer their car as ‘she’ — especially, if they’re extremely fond of the vehicle. For example, this is my old Maruti 800. She’s been with me for nearly 15 years.”
“The new car that my dad has is really good. She gives nearly 20 kilometres per litre.”
“That’s great!”
