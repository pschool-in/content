“Rajesh is getting married next week. He’s having a party at his place tonight.”
“That’s nice. Is Meera coming with you?”
“Unfortunately, I can’t ask her to come. It’s a stag party.”
“It’s a what party? What did you say?”
“S...t...a...g. Stag! It rhymes with ‘tag’, ‘bag’ and ‘lag’. When you say that it’s a ‘stag’ party, you mean there won’t be any women present at the event. It’ll only be men.”
“That makes sense. A ‘stag’ is actually a male deer, isn’t it?”
“Yes, that’s right! Since the people at the event will all be men…”
“Such events are called ‘stag’ parties. Tell me, since a female deer is called a ‘doe’, are parties that only ladies attend called ‘doe’ parties?”
“Very good! Some people do refer to them as ‘doe party’. But the common term to refer to such parties is ‘hen’ party.”
“Hen party? That doesn’t make any sense! Why would they call it that?”
“Because the word ‘hen’ in this context doesn’t refer to the adult female chicken. It refers to any female bird. Many female birds are called ‘hen’. The same is true of the word ‘stag’. In the past, male animals in their prime were called stags.”
For fun
“I see. If this hadn’t been a stag party, would you have asked Meera to come with you?”
“I don’t think so. Unlike many of my friends, Meera is not a party animal.”
“Party animal? Does it mean someone who loves attending parties?”
“Very good! That’s exactly what it means. A party animal is someone who loves going to parties and goes to as many as possible. Ganesh doesn’t like attending parties. His wife, on the other hand, is a real party animal.”
“How about this example? During our trip to Goa, my friend and I did a lot of trekking. The party animals in our group, however, enjoyed themselves on the beach.”
“That’s an excellent example. Now tell me, what have…”
“Is there a term for someone who comes to parties reluctantly? He doesn’t really enjoy himself, and in the process makes sure that the others don’t either.”
“Such a person is called a ‘party pooper’! He spoils your fun. He’s a real ‘killjoy’. Please don’t invite Ram to this evening’s function. He’s a real party pooper.”
“I’ve come to this restaurant to enjoy myself, Veda. So don’t be a party pooper by talking about work.”
“Good example. Rajesh didn’t invite his boss because he’s a real party pooper.”
“Good reason not to invite someone, I suppose.”

“I didn’t get any sleep at all. Like most people, I was caught up in the match. Didn’t you watch it? It was really exciting.”
“I think I watched the first 20 minutes. After that, I conked out on the sofa.”
“You conked out on the sofa? Does it mean you fell asleep on the sofa?”
“When you ‘conk out’, you fall asleep quite quickly.”
“Why is that? Is it because you’re tired or exhausted?”
“That’s right! You’re so tired that you fall asleep immediately. You just collapse.
After five sets of tennis, I conked out as soon as I got home.”
“My sister was really tired. It wasn’t surprising that she conked out during the lecture.”
“After four hours of trekking, some of the kids conked out even before dinner.”
“But I was always under the impression that ‘conk out’ was usually used with machines. People always talk about machines conking out.”
“You’re absolutely right! When something like a car or a computer stops working suddenly, you normally say that it’s conked out.”
“So, in both cases, something happens suddenly. The person falls asleep unexpectedly and a machine stops working suddenly.”
“Exactly! The bus conked out even before we’d reached Nagpur.”
“We haven’t had power since yesterday. To make matters worse, our inverter conked out this morning.”
“That’s a good example. The TV conked out while I was watching the match.”
“Your TV has conked out? Is that why you didn’t watch the match last night?”
Similar in meaning
“No, my TV is fine. That was just an example. It was so cloudy that I thought that the match would get rained out.”
“So did many people. Tell me, is there a difference between ‘rained out’ and ‘rained off’?”
“In terms of meaning there’s no difference. When you say that a match was rained out or rained off, what you’re suggesting is that it was washed out.”
“In other words, the match had to be cancelled because of the persistent rain.”
“I guess you could say that. ‘Rained out’ is preferred by the Americans, while ‘rained off’ seems to be preferred by the British.”
“The children were disappointed because most of the weekend matches were rained off. Tell me, how’s your project coming along?”
“I finished it a week ago. I need to get feedback from my new boss. It might take some time because he’s a bit of a stuffed shirt.”
“Stuffed shirt? What does it mean?”
“When you refer to someone as being a ‘stuffed shirt’, what you’re suggesting is that the individual is rather old fashioned in his outlook.”
“Old fashioned? It sounds like my grandfather.”
“I don’t think I would call your grandfather a stuffed shirt. The expression also suggests that the person in question is a pompous individual. He is someone who believes that his ideas are extremely important.”
“My grandfather is old-fashioned, but I don’t think he is very formal or takes himself seriously. He’s fun to be around with.”
“In that case, he’s not a stuffed shirt. Remember, the expression is mostly used with men. The new Chief Minister is very different from all the stuffed shirts we’ve had so far.”
“How about this example? I’ve met Ritu’s father a couple of times. He didn’t come across as a stuffed shirt.”
“Sounds good. Now, tell me....”
“No, you tell me. Why stuffed shirt? Where did the expression come from?”
“We’ll talk about it some other time.”

“Yes, my neighbour told me. I couldn’t make it because I was in the arms of Morpheus.”
“You were in Morpheus’ arms? Who is this person?”
“Morpheus is the Greek god of dreams. When you say you were in the...”
“In the arms of Morpheus, what you mean is that you were sound asleep.”
“That’s exactly what it means. Here’s an example. Could you please turn down the volume? The baby is in the arms of Morpheus.”
“I was really tired yesterday. I was in the arms of Morpheus by nine last night.”
“By the way, it is from the name Morpheus that we get the word ‘morphine’ — the drug that is given to patients when they’re in considerable pain.”
“I see. I didn’t expect so many people to turn up for the talk yesterday.”
The sports connect
“It’s not surprising that people did. After all, the speaker is a well-known cricket player. You know that in India most players are lionised.”
“Lionised? Does it mean to treat someone with respect?”
“That’s right! When you ‘lionise’ someone, you treat them with respect — perhaps, too much respect. You give them special treatment because you think they’re a celebrity. The party President was lionised by the local workers.”
“The General was lionised by all those who served under him.”
“Good example! So, tell me, who’s picking me up tomorrow morning?”
“She would be here by six tomorrow!”
“That’s not likely to happen. You know what they say, a leopard never changes its spots.”
“A leopard never changes its spots? What are you talking about?”
“When you say that ‘a leopard never changes its spots’ or ‘can’t change its spots’, what you are suggesting is that no matter how hard a person tries, he/she will not be able to change his/her true nature.”
“In other words, you are saying no matter how hard Vinita tries, she will continue to be lazy. She will always be late for everything.”
“Very good! Vinita cannot change who she is. The expression is mostly used with something negative. My cousin Govind says that he is going to stop taking bribes. But do you seriously think a leopard can change its spots?”
“The child promised her parents that she would stop lying. If you ask me, it is near impossible for a leopard to change its spots.”
“That’s a good example. It’s also possible to say, ‘a tiger doesn’t change its stripes’. For example, I don’t believe Malathi when she says that she doesn’t shout at her servant anymore. A tiger doesn’t change its stripes.”
“While we are on the subject of tigers, what does ‘paper tiger’ mean?”
“The term can be used with things and people. When you refer to someone as a ‘paper tiger’, what you are suggesting is that the person looks or appears to be strong or powerful. But he is, in fact, very weak.”
“In other words, he looks like he’s the person in charge. In truth, he has no power at all.”
“Exactly! For a very long time, our batsmen were paper tigers. They used to score a lot of runs in India, but when they went abroad, they failed miserably.”
“Some of the new anti-smoking laws introduced by the Government are nothing more than paper tigers. People who smoke in public places are seldom punished.”
“That’s true.”

“I am really sorry about that. But I had to go to the airport to see my friend off. He and his family are emigrating...migrating to Australia. Which is correct? Emigrating or...”
“Well, in this context, both emigrating and migrating are acceptable.”
“So, are you saying there is no difference between the two words?”
“I didn’t say that! The word ‘emigrate’ comes from the Latin ‘emigrare’ meaning ‘to depart from a place’. So, when you ‘emigrate’, you leave one place and go to another. Nowadays, the word is mostly used when a person moves from one country to another.”
“This move to another country is usually permanent, isn’t it? In the case of my friend, he is going to be settling down in Australia.”
“His family is moving from India to Australia. Which is why careful users of the language argue that one always emigrates ‘from’ one country ‘to’ another. Sadhana emigrated from India to France.”
“So, is it wrong to say, Sadhana emigrated to France?”
“Not anymore. A lot of native speakers say ‘emigrate to’ and ‘migrate to”
“I know that when one emigrates, one moves from one country to another. What about...”
“When you move from one country to another, you can use either migrate or emigrate. For example, many of my cousins are just dying to migrate to America.”
“Quite a few people in my family want to migrate to Russia.”
“I didn’t know that. Unlike ‘emigrate’, the word ‘migrate’ can be used to refer to one’s moving from one part of the country to another.”
“You mean like moving from Chennai to Kolkata or Mumbai?”
“That’s right. In the case of ‘migrate’, the move need not necessarily be to a foreign country. It can be within one’s own. Also, the move need not necessarily be permanent.”
“I guess that explains why people who move from one part of the country to another looking for work are often called ‘migrant’ workers. Why are you smiling? You look really happy about something.”
Eat your heart out
“This afternoon I managed to figure out who was stealing our office supplies. Sherlock Holmes, eat your heart out.”
“Why should poor Sherlock Holmes eat his heart out? What are you talking about?”
“The expression, ‘eat your heart out’ is usually followed by the name of a famous individual. In my example, what I am jokingly suggesting is that I am a better detective than Sherlock Holmes — that he would be extremely jealous of my ability to solve cases.”
“So the famous person you are comparing yourself to could be alive or dead?”
“That’s right. He only needs to be famous, that’s all.”
“This comparison between you and Holmes is not meant to be taken seriously, right?”
“Exactly! I know that I am not as good as Holmes. It’s my attempt to be funny. Here is another example. During his wonderful innings, Suresh hit a couple of beautiful cover drives. Eat your heart out, Kohli.”
“How about this example? My brother’s singing had the audience dancing in the aisles. Eat your heart out, Kishore Kumar.”
“Sounds good!”

“That’s good to know. Sounds to me like Vasu has the Midas touch.”
“Midas touch? Does it mean someone who makes a lot of money?”
“When you say that someone has the Midas touch, what you’re suggesting is that every venture they undertake is successful.”
“And because it’s successful, the person ends up making a lot of money.”
“Exactly! Our company is looking for someone young who has the Midas touch.”
“How about this example? My cousin’s Midas touch has made my uncle’s company famous in Chennai.”
“Sounds good. Let’s hope your cousin doesn’t lose his Midas touch anytime soon.”
“Tell me, who was Midas? Was he a businessman or something?”
“No, he was a king. He asked Dionysus, a Greek god, to grant him a boon — that whatever he touched should turn to gold.”
“Oh, I know this story. Soon Midas realises that he’s made a big mistake by asking for such a boon because whatever he touches turns to gold. His food turns to gold and even his daughter. But tell me, is there a word for someone who loses money all the time?”
Reverse effect
“You mean someone whose ventures always fail?”
“Yes, that’s right! Someone who ruins everything he touches. Someone who...”
“Many people use the expression ‘reverse Midas touch’. I don’t think any company would ever hire Dilip. He’s well known for his reverse Midas touch.”
“Some businessmen I read about had the reverse Midas touch.”
“Some people refer to this as the ‘Sadim touch’. It’s the name Midas spelt backwards.”
“Luckily Vasu doesn’t have the Sadim touch. He is owning so many factories now...”
“You cannot say that he’s owning something. You have to say, ‘He owns something’.”
“Oh yes, now I remember. It’s like the word ‘have’. You do not say, ‘I’m having a house’. You have to say, ‘I have a house’.”
“Exactly! You always ‘own’ something, not ‘owning something’. Some of my friends own a lot of property on the outskirts of the city.”
“My aunt owns several houses in the city.”
“Do you think she’d be willing to sell one of them? My father is looking for one.”
“Really? I can ask my aunt. But I wouldn’t hold my breath if I were you.”
“Hold my breath? Why would I hold my breath? What are you talking about?”
“What Im suggesting is that my aunt is unlikely to sell any of her houses. The expression ‘don’t hold your breath’ is usually used in informal contexts to suggest that something is not likely to happen.”
“And even if it does, it’s going to happen after a very long time. Not immediately.”
“Exactly! And there’s no way you can hold your breath for that long. Here’s an example. The plumber said that he’d be here in half an hour. But if I were you, I wouldn’t hold my breath.”
“We have been promised a big bonus this year. But don’t hold your breath.”
“That’s a good example. The Chief Minister has promised there will be no power and water shortage from next year. But don’t hold your breath.”
“I certainly don’t intend to hold my breath.”

“And since you’ve stayed in the hotel for three years, you feel very much at home.”
“Even though it is not fancy, I feel very comfortable there. This old motorcycle might not look like much. But Manish says that It is comfortable as an old shoe to drive around in.”

“Shoehorned? Isn’t a shoehorn what some people use when they are putting on their shoes? I remember my grandfather always used one when he put his shoes on.”
“That’s right! The word ‘shoehorn’ can be used as a verb as well. When you say that something has been ‘shoehorned’, what you are suggesting is that it has been squeezed in between two things.”
“In other words, It is been sandwiched between two things. It is a very tight fit.”
“Exactly! Fifteen motorcycles had been shoehorned into the small garage.”
“The Club is planning to shoehorn a tennis court between the swimming pool and the cricket ground.”

“In other words, your finances are very limited. It is barely adequate. How about this example? Many independent film producers manage to make excellent films on a shoestring budget.”
“That’s an excellent example. The word ‘shoestring’ is mostly used in American English to refer to one’s shoelace. The expression ‘on a shoestring budget’ is mostly limited to informal contexts. Anand visited quite a few countries on a shoestring budget.”
