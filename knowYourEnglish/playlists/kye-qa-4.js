          text: `What is the difference between ‘intolerable’ and ‘intolerant’?
When you say that the situation that you are in has become ‘intolerable’, what you are suggesting is that it has become unbearable; you find it extremely difficult to deal with. The word can be used with both people and things. For example, when you say that the movie was intolerably boring, what you are suggesting is that you could not sit through it. The word ‘intolerant’, on the other hand, is mostly used with people, and it is always used to show disapproval. Someone who is intolerant is very narrow minded; he is not very accepting. He is not willing to consider ideas or beliefs of others that are different from his own; he expects everyone to be like him. One is usually ‘intolerant of’ someone or something.
My grandmother is very intolerant of girls who wear jeans and t-shirt.
You’re our party leader. How can you be so intolerant of other people’s beliefs?
The constant criticism from his boss made Ravi’s life at work intolerable.
The pain from the wound was becoming intolerable.
What is the meaning of ‘be in it for the long haul’? 
This is an expression that is quite frequently used in American English in informal contexts. When you say that you are going to be in something for the long haul, what you are suggesting is that you are going to be committed to it or be involved in it for a very long time. If the something is a project, then you will continue to work on it till it has been successfully completed. You realise from the beginning that it is going to take a long time to complete, and no matter what, you are not going to abandon it anytime soon.
The people of the town are very sceptical about the project. We need to convince them we’re in it for the long haul.
Jai knows that being a doctor in a small village is very difficult, but he said he’s in it for the long haul.
Can the word ‘mothball’ be used as a verb?
Yes, it can. When used as a noun, the word refers to the white balls that we normally put in trunks and suitcases when we wish to put our winter clothes away — we do this in order to keep the moths and other insects away. When used as a verb, the word ‘mothball’ means to ‘cancel or postpone’ work on a project. If a company mothballs one of its factories, it means that it is going to shut it down temporarily or for a very long time.
The University’s plan to start a new centre in Kochi has been mothballed.
If you ask me, all these old buildings need to be mothballed.
Is it okay to say, ‘Everyone wants to see the latest Star Wars movie, and Prithi is not an exception’? 
No, it is not. The standard expression is ‘and X is no exception’, and not ‘and X is not an exception’.
All children love chocolate ice cream, and Anika is no exception.
Every Sunday I go to the beach, and last Sunday was no exception.
A smart person knows all the rules so he can break them wisely. — Lubna Azmi`

          text: `What is the meaning of the expression ‘strut your stuff’?
The word ‘strut’ is normally used to refer to the manner in which an individual walks. When you ‘strut’, you are trying to get everyone to notice you; you attempt to impress others with your confident and proud walk. The expression ‘strut your stuff’ is used in informal contexts to suggest how well someone is performing in public. This individual who is good at something performs brilliantly and impresses those around him or her. The aim here is to win the approval of those watching — the person is being a show-off.
Dilip and Rani were itching to strut their stuff on the dance floor.
Some of the talented people in the company got a chance to strut their stuff.
What is the meaning of ‘soul brother’?
African-Americans first used the expressions ‘soul brother’ and ‘soul sister’ as a term of address. Nowadays, when a man refers to another man as being his soul brother, what he is suggesting is that the two are alike in many ways — both have similar opinions about certain things, have similar interests, and so on. They are, what people would call, a ‘kindred spirit’.
If you ask me, Usha and Sarita are soul sisters.
Ganesh seems to have found a soul brother in John.
How is the word ‘carnivorous’ pronounced?
One simple way is to reduce the word to three syllables. The first syllable can be pronounced like the word ‘car’, and the vowel in the second like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘hit’ and ‘pit’. The first ‘o’ remains silent and the second sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. Many people pronounce this word ‘car-NIV-res’ with the stress on the second syllable. It is also possible to pronounce the first and second ‘o’ like the ‘a’ in ‘china’; when this happens, the word is pronounced ‘car-NIV-e-res’. In both cases, the stress is on the second syllable. Animals and plants that eat meat are said to be carnivorous. The word comes from the Latin ‘carnivorus’ meaning ‘feeding on flesh’. A non-vegetarian is sometimes humorously referred to as a ‘carnivore’.
Be careful! Some of the plants being grown here are carnivorous.
Nayaz didn’t know that certain varieties of turtles were carnivorous.
What is the difference between ‘euphoric’ and ‘elated’?
In both cases, you are very happy and excited about something that has happened or is about to happen. ‘Euphoric’ suggests that you are overly happy, and the contentment that you are feeling is temporary; it is going to be short-lived. The word comes from the Greek ‘euphoros’ meaning ‘borne well, healthy’. It was first used to refer to the temporary sense of well-being that drugs and medicines induced in a patient. When you are ‘elated’ about something, you are extremely happy about it; you are absolutely delighted with the success or the good fortune that has come your way. It is not a case of exaggerated happiness.
Shruthi’s parents were elated when she was made captain.
The players were euphoric after winning the championship.

If you were celebrating an occasion, how would your friends react if they saw a skeleton seated in a chair next to yours? Would it help to lighten or dampen the mood? When you refer to someone as being a ‘skeleton at the feast’, what you are suggesting is that he is a wet blanket — in other words, someone who is likely to dampen the mood of all those around him. He is someone who intentionally or unintentionally prevents others from having a good time — a real ‘party pooper’!
Don’t invite Chandini. She has the reputation of being a skeleton at the feast.
I want someone who will be the life of the party — not a skeleton at the feast.
According to Plutarch, the ancient Egyptians had the custom of placing a skeleton or a mummy at their banquet table. This was one way of reminding the guests of their own mortality — that life was short and therefore it was to be enjoyed while it lasted. When this expression became part of the English language hundreds of years later, it took on a very negative meaning.
What is the difference between ‘immerse’ and ‘dip’?
In both cases, you are taking an object and putting it into a liquid. When you ‘immerse’ an object into water, you are pushing it all the way down — in other words, the object is completely covered by water. The object may be pushed under water very quickly or very slowly. When you ‘dip’ an object into a liquid, you usually lower a part of it into the liquid and that too for a very short period of time. For example, some people ‘dip’ a biscuit into their morning tea before eating it. In this case, it is not the entire biscuit, but only a small portion that is lowered into the cup. When you have a ‘dip’ in the river, you get your entire body wet, but spend only a very little time in the water. These are just some of the differences between the two words.
The doctor immersed the instruments in boiling water for twenty minutes.
Mohan dipped his finger into the bowl to check how hot the soup was.
How is the word ‘ensemble’ pronounced? 
The ‘e’ in the first and second syllable is pronounced like the ‘o’ in ‘on’, ‘don’ and ‘con’. The final syllable sounds like the ‘ble’ in ‘tremble’, ‘trouble’ and ‘double’. The word is pronounced ‘on-SOM-bel’ with the stress on the second syllable. It comes from the Latin ‘insimul’ meaning ‘at the same time’. Nowadays, the word is normally used to refer a group of people — usually musicians, dancers or actors — who always play or perform together. It can also be used to refer to a set of something — clothes, upholstery, etc. — that go together.
Prithi was only interested in the earrings, but the salesman was trying to get her into buying the whole ensemble — shoes, dress, bracelets, etc.
You’ll enjoy the show. We have an ensemble of very fine actors.

The Greek word ‘theos’ means ‘God’; a ‘theist’, therefore, is someone who believes in the existence of God. A ‘theist’ may or may not be religious. The prefix ‘a’ in Greek means ‘not’. An ‘atheist’ is someone who is absolutely certain that God does not exist. He has no iota of doubt about it. Unlike the word ‘atheist’, ‘agnostic’ is a word of recent origin. According scholars, the term was coined by English biologist Thomas Huxley at a party in 1869. ‘Agnostos’ in Greek means ‘unknown’. Dictionaries define an ‘agnostic’ as someone “who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or the nature of God.” An ‘agnostic’ is someone who neither denies nor accepts the existence of God.
Revathi is religious. Her husband, on the other hand, is an atheist.
He claims to be an agnostic — but becomes religious before every exam!
What is the meaning and origin of ‘fit as a fiddle’?
When you say that someone is ‘fit as a fiddle’ what you are suggesting is that the person is in excellent physical condition; he is someone who is in the ‘pink of health’.
Playing four sets of tennis every day keeps Joseph fit as a fiddle.
Don’t let Shalini’s skinny looks fool you. She’s fit as a fiddle.
No one is really sure about the origin of this idiom. Some scholars believe that the original idiom was ‘fit as a fiddler’. According to this interesting theory, in the past, violinists or ‘fiddlers’ in Ireland were expected to keep the guests entertained by playing from dusk to dawn — in order to achieve this, they needed to be extremely fit.
How is word ‘grotesque’ pronounced? 
This is another example of how there is no connection between the way a word is spelt in English and the manner in which it is pronounced. The first syllable is pronounced like the word ‘grow’, and the following ‘tesq’ rhymes with the word ‘desk’. The final ‘ue’ is silent. Some people pronounce the first vowel like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word can be pronounced ‘grow-TESK’ or ‘gre-TESK’. It has several meanings. When you say that something is grotesque to look at, what you are suggesting is that it is unpleasant or frightening to look at.
Your drawings are simply grotesque.
I found Dilip’s dance movements grotesque.
Is it correct to say ‘fair something out’?
When we ask someone to ‘fair something out’, what we would like him or her to do is to write the final version of a document — by carrying out all the corrections to the previous version. Standard dictionaries that list this expression make it clear that it is an example of Indian English. Native speakers of English do not say ‘fair something out’. They normally say ‘make a copy of’ or ‘make a fair copy of’ something.
After Usha has checked everything, make a fair copy of the document.
In the old days, it used to take hours to make a fair copy of anything.

        text: ` What is the meaning and origin of ‘to go rogue’?
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘rogue’; the first vowel sounds like the ‘o’ in ‘no’, ‘so’ and ‘go’, and the ‘u’ and ‘e’ are silent. The word can be used in everyday contexts to show disapproval and approval. When you call someone a ‘rogue’, you are suggesting that he is a dishonest person, someone who cannot be trusted, and is perhaps dangerous. The word can be used with things as well. The American media, for example, frequently refer to North Korea as a ‘rogue nation’. It can also be used as a term of endearment — someone whom you find appealing, but whose behaviour or actions you do not approve of. The expression ‘to go rogue’ is mostly used in the context of politics to show disapproval. When a politician goes rogue, he does his own thing; he becomes unpredictable in his behaviour and often stops following the orders of the party high command. As far as the other members of the party are concerned, he is dangerous. When an animal or a country goes rogue, it behaves in a dangerous fashion.
Several MPs went rogue and voted against the proposed bill.
According to scholars, the expression was first used to refer to a solitary elephant — one that was no longer part of a herd — that had become rather violent and destructive.
How is the word ‘cervical’ pronounced?
There are two distinct ways of pronouncing this word. One way is to pronounce the first syllable like the word ‘sir’ and the following vowel like the ‘i’ in ‘sit’, ‘bit and ‘kit’. The final ‘a’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word can be pronounced ‘SIR-vi-kel’ with the stress on the first syllable. It is also possible to pronounce the ‘i’ like the ‘y’ in ‘my’, ‘by’ and ‘sky’. In this case, the word is pronounced ‘sir-VY-kel’ with the stress on the second syllable. The word comes from the Latin ‘cervis’ meaning ‘neck’.
What is the difference between ‘unappreciated’ and ‘underappreciated’?
Both have a negative connotation; they suggest that you are not happy or satisfied about something. When the work that you do remains ‘unappreciated’, what it suggests is that you feel that people around you do not value or appreciate what you have done. They fail to acknowledge or realise the value of the work. When your colleagues ‘underappreciate’ the work you do, what it suggests is that they do not value it enough. In this case, they do value your work, but at the back of your mind, you feel they do not give the credit that it is due. In your opinion, it could be appreciated or valued more.
If you ask me, Nandini is one of the underappreciated teachers in college.
No matter what you do or say, Ramani always feels unappreciated.
Which is correct? ‘It’s a quarter past twelve’ or ‘It’s quarter past twelve’? 
Native speakers of English use both. It is possible to say ‘It’s (a) quarter past twelve’ and ‘It’s (a) quarter to twelve’. But if the time is 12:30, native speakers generally say ‘It’s half past twelve’ - without ‘a’.

When Kim Jong-Un took a jab at Donald Trump by calling him a ‘dotard’, people made a beeline for the dictionary. For several hours, it was the most referred to word in most online dictionaries. The first syllable ‘dot’ rhymes with ‘boat’, ‘coat’ and ‘goat’, and the final ‘ar’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘DOAT-ed’ with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the German ‘doten’ meaning ‘to be foolish’. The word is used nowadays to mean an old person who has become feeble — both physically and mentally.

This is an expression that has been around for several centuries, and it is mostly used to suggest that someone is doing something with a lot energy or enthusiasm.

When there is no electricity, we use the word ‘blackout’. Is there a word to describe a situation when the voltage is low? 
Low voltage is a common problem in our country — especially during the summer months. When this happens, the tube lights keep flickering, and some of the other bulbs burn rather dimly. The Americans have a term for this dip in voltage — they call it ‘brownout’.
Arun never uses any of his electrical appliances during a brownout.
We always experience brownouts in the early morning.
What is the difference between ‘bribe’ and ‘graft’? 
There is a tendency nowadays to use the two words interchangeably; both refer to the corrupt practices adopted by people to gain advantages of different kinds. Of the two, ‘bribe’ is the more general term. Anyone can be bribed to do something for you — politicians, businessmen, auto rickshaw drivers and even children. The piece of chocolate that parents dangle before a child in order to get him/her to do something can be considered a ‘bribe’.
The word ‘graft’, on the other hand, is mostly used in the context of politics; it is a form of political corruption. When someone who is working for the government takes money in order to do a job for you, he is taking graft. He is using his power and authority in the government to obtain money. Public officials take ‘graft’; others take a bribe. Even native speakers of English, however, do not always maintain this distinction between the two words.
Kamana was found guilty and sent to prison on charges of graft.
We paid the doorman a bribe to get into the building.

“Let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.” This is the opening line of the famous song ‘Do Re Mi’ from the movie The Sound of Music. It more or less sums up the meaning of the expression. When you ‘start from scratch’, you make a fresh or a new start; you create something new. If, after reading your report, your boss tells you to start from scratch, what he wants you to do is to rewrite it. He wants you to discard the first draft and start afresh. He wants something new, something better.
Our clients didn’t like any of our ideas. So we had to discard everything and start from scratch.

How is the word ‘myriad’ pronounced? 
The ‘y’ and ‘i’ are pronounced like the ‘i’ in ‘bit’, ‘sit’ and ‘kit’, and the ‘a’ is like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. The word is pronounced ‘MI-ri-ed- with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Greek ‘murias’ meaning ‘ten thousand’. Nowadays, the word is used both as an adjective and a noun to mean ‘countless’ or ‘very large number’. It is mostly limited to formal contexts.
When we moved into this house, we had myriad problems.
There are myriads of English medium schools in the city.
What is the difference between ‘adjacent’ and ‘adjoining’? 
Some people use the two words interchangeably, but careful users of the language maintain a subtle distinction between them. Two houses that are adjacent to each other could be next to each other or near each other. They are side by side, but are not touching each other. ‘Adjoining’, on the other hand, suggests that the two houses are ‘joined’; they touch each other. For example, when you say Andhra Pradesh adjoins Odisha, what you are suggesting is that the two States have a common border. One usually talks about something being ‘adjacent to’ something. ‘To’ is not used in the case of ‘adjoin’.
Amrit wants the study to be adjacent to the balcony.
Ganesh lives in a huge house adjoining the famous golf course.
Is ‘agenda’ followed by a singular or plural verb? 
There was a time when ‘agenda’, meaning ‘things to be done’, was considered to be the plural form of the Latin ‘agendum’. It was, therefore, always followed by a plural verb. But times have changed; ‘agenda’ is now considered to be a singular noun - it is always followed by a singular verb. The plural form is ‘agendas’.
The agenda for tomorrow’s meeting hasn’t been sent as yet.
