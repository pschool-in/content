          text: `“After shouting at me for five minutes, she tells me I know nothing about computers.”
“That’s how Sujatha is! You know that! Now, pull yourself together and get on with the job at hand.”
“Pull myself together? How do I do that?”
“When you tell someone to pull himself together, what you’re asking him to do is to calm down — to stop being angry or upset about something.”
“In other words, you want me to regain my composure. How about this example? Sujatha’s dad has always been tough on her. Whenever something didn’t go according to plan, he told her to pull herself together.”
“When Devashish lost the election by two votes, we thought he would be devastated. But he pulled himself together in no time.”
“That’s true. Although everyone expected the race to be neck to neck, I don’t think anyone expected Devashish to lose.”
“I don’t think he did either. By the way, it’s ‘neck and neck’ and not ‘neck to neck’.”
“The race is too close to call. The three candidates are running neck and neck.”
“My grandmother says as you get older, it becomes difficult to pull yourself together.”
“That’s understandable, I guess. As you get older, it becomes difficult to deal with the unexpected. Talking about the unexpected, I hear that you and your friends are throwing your boss a surprise party.”
Not a surprise
“Who told you about the party? Who let the cat out of the bag?”
“Cat? What cat? What are you talking about?”
“When you say, ‘don’t let the cat out of the bag’, what you mean is keep it a secret. In this case, don’t tell anyone about the party.”
“And if someone does let the cat out the bag, it means that they have revealed the secret.”
“That’s right! They may have revealed the secret to someone quite unintentionally — accidentally. Only two people in our office knew about the merger, and they did not let the cat out of the bag till the two companies had signed the relevant contracts.”
“Rupa wanted her engagement to Suresh to be a secret. But her best friend Shanthi let the cat out of the bag.”
“So, who let the cat out of the bag regarding the party? Was it Suman?”
“How does it matter? How is your boss’ new house? I saw the ad in the paper, and...”
“The complex is quite fancy, all right! Considering how much the builder was charging for each villa, I thought the construction work was pretty slipshod.”
“Slipshod? Does it mean a careless piece of work? Not well done?”
“That’s right! When you say that a piece of work is slipshod, what you’re suggesting is that it hasn’t been well thought out or executed. It’s crude and full of mistakes. The new manager was fired when he made a slipshod presentation at the board meeting.”
“The assignment we submitted was slipshod. We’ve been asked to redo it.”
“Praveen is a wonderful carpenter. But whatever you do, never hurry him. If you do, he gets angry and does a slipshod job.”
“In that case, I’ll stay out of his way.”

“Instead of making me guess, why don’t you save us both some time and just spit it out?”
“Spit it out? What are you talking about? There’s nothing in my mouth to spit out.”
“When you tell someone ‘to spit something out’, what you would like him or her to do is to say what’s on his or her mind.”
“I see. You want him to tell you what he’s thinking about. In other words, what’s going through his mind!”
“That’s right! It is an expression mostly used in informal contexts. Here’s an example. I know you’re dying to tell us Navin’s secret. Come on, spit it out.”
“No way! I promised him, I would tell no one. There’s no way I’m spitting it out!”
“In that case, spit out the interesting thing my neighbour told you.”
“It was about the speech that the Chief Minister gave last night. He said...”
“A speech given by a politician! Forget it!”
“Did you listen to our Chief Minister’s speech last night?”
“I was busy watching the match. Since when did you get interested in politics?”
To compliment or not
“I’m not! I was watching the match too. But my father switched channels at nine. Ended up listening to some of the speech. I was surprised to hear the Chief Minister pay the members of Opposition several compliments.”
“According to this morning newspaper reports, they were left-handed compliments.”
“Left-handed compliments? Are you saying they were not compliments?”
“When you say that something is a ‘left-handed compliment’, what you’re suggesting is that what sounds like a compliment isn’t one — it is, in fact, an insult.”
“In other words, it is a ‘backhanded’ compliment.”
“Exactly! Sujatha told me that I had a nice smile. But it turned out to be left-handed compliment. She went on to ask me who my dentist was.”
“Implying that that the secret behind your beautiful smile was your dentist. That sounds like Sujatha all right! Whenever she pays you a compliment, you can be pretty sure that it’s a left-handed one.”
“Some politicians are famous for their backhanded compliments. So, tell me, ...”
“No, you tell me. How do you pronounce ‘s..h..o..o’? Does it sound like ‘shoe’?”
“That’s right! ‘Shoo’ is the sound you make when you attempt to drive or scare an animal away. One can ‘shoo away’ an animal or one can ‘shoo away’ a person.”
“How about this example? Revathi shooed me away because the baby was sleeping.”
“That’s a good example. My grandfather spends most of his early mornings shooing the birds away.”
“The kids went to my grandmother to say they were sorry, but she shooed them away.”
“Good example. But I don’t think any grandmother would do that!
“But she did! She was so shocked by their...shocked at their behaviour...Which one is correct? Shocked at or shocked by their behaviour?
“The two can be used interchangeably in most contexts, actually. Indians, in general, prefer ‘shocked by’. The teachers and the parents were shocked by/at the Chief Guest’s comments. They wrote a strong letter of protest.”
“Most people were shocked by/at the children’s behaviour.”
“Now, please leave before I shoo you away.”

“Karthik and business? I don’t think he has the smarts to run a business.”
“The smarts? Are you saying that he’s not smart enough to run a business?”
“In informal contexts, the word ‘smarts’ is used to mean intelligence. Especially the kind of intelligence you require to handle a difficult situation.”
“The average Indian politician has the smarts to wriggle out of any tricky situation.”
“My uncle believes that if my boss had any smarts, he would make me a manager soon.”
“You are lucky to have such an uncle. Mine thinks I don’t have the smarts to graduate.”
“Ouch! This must be your uncle in Florida. How is he doing by the way?”
“He is doing okay. Hurricane Irma damaged his house quite badly.”
“What else do you expect from a war goddess. I’m sure she...”
“War goddess? What are you talking about?”
“Irma is actually the name of a war goddess. She’s always...”
“Like any war goddess, this hurricane destroyed quite a few things in its path. Could you please explain me how the word...”
“How many times do I have to tell you, it’s not ‘explain me’, but ‘explain to me’? Could you please explain to me how to solve this problem?”
“I explained to John why he shouldn’t spend money on a new cell phone.”
“Or you could also say, I explained why he shouldn’t spend money on a new cell phone.”
“The principal explained why the teachers were going on strike. Now, could you tell me how h..u..n..k..e..r is pronounced?”
“The first syllable rhymes with ‘skunk’, ‘bunk’ and ‘sunk’. Why do you ask?”
“When I was reading about the storm in Florida, most reports said that people had to hunker down. I was wondering...”
Taking refuge
“The word ‘hunker’ is mostly used in American English in informal contexts to mean to squat. When you ‘hunker down’, you sit on your heels with your knees bent.”
“Like a wicket keeper, you mean?”
“I guess you could say that. The expression has another meaning as well. When you ‘hunker down’, you settle down. You make yourself as comfortable as possible because you have a long wait ahead of you.”
“Since the situation you’re in is a difficult or a dangerous one, you’re taking refuge.”
“Exactly! A few weeks ago, the people in Miami hunkered down for a storm.”
“During the riots in the city, we hunkered down in our neighbour’s house.”
“That’s a good example. Reporters hunkered down in the park opposite the actor’s house.”
“My uncle and his family hunkered down in a school near their house. They’ve shifted to an apartment since... Tell me, does one ‘shift’ or ‘move’ to a new house?”
“We Indians generally use ‘shift’. But native speakers prefer ‘move’. I’m planning to move into a bigger apartment next year.”
“How about this example? My father thinks our colony has become very crowded. He wants to move house.”
“God bless your father!”

“I haven’t been to that part of the town in a while. Has it changed much?”
“Not really! I think I did a mistake when I said...”
“One does not ‘do’ a mistake, one ‘makes’ a mistake. Sujatha gets really upset when people make mistakes.”
“I don’t understand why she does. We all make mistakes. Tell me, is it ‘living in’ or ‘living on’ a street? I always get confused.”
“One can live in or live on a particular street or road. As far as the meaning is concerned, there’s no difference between the two. Many years ago, my cousins lived on Eldams Road.”
“Sujatha, as you know, lives in Prince Street. By the way, I met her yesterday, and she’s decided not to join either TCS or Infosys. She said she was going to help her father run his business.”
“That’s a smart thing to do, if you ask me. You know what they say! It’s better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion.”
Leadership role
“I’ve never heard that expression before. What does it mean?”
“It’s an expression mostly used in informal contexts. What you’re trying to say is that it’s better to be in a leadership position in a small organisation than...”
“Than work for a big company where you don’t have much to do. Instead of giving orders to people, you merely follow orders given by others.”
“Exactly! Being a leader in a small company is worth a lot more than being a follower in a big company.”
“How about this example? An MNC offered to double Sridhar’s salary. But he chose to stay with the startup company because he thought it was better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion.”
“That’s a good example. His father did the exact opposite. He jumped at the offer made by an MNC. He didn’t realise that being the head of a dog was better than being the tail of a lion. Now, the poor man is stuck. Doesn’t know what to do.”
“His two kids have great jobs. Why doesn’t he just retire?”
“That’s what Sridhar wants. He thinks it’s high time his father retired.”
“High time he retired? Tell me, is there a difference between ‘high time he retired’ and ‘it’s time he retired’? Some people say...”
“When you say it’s ‘high time’ he retired, what you’re suggesting is that it’s about time he retired. The expression also carries with it the sense that the person should have retired a long time ago. The retirement is overdue.”
“How about this example? It’s high time you study for the test.”
“The expression ‘high time’ is usually followed by the past tense form of the verb. It’s high time you studied for the test.”
“I’m sure your parents think that it’s high time you got married.”
“I think it’s high time you went home.”

“That’s to be expected, I guess. He was our former employee.”
“Really? He says there was pin drop silence when the CEO’s wife sang. Is that true?”
“Of course, not! People were chatting away. By the way, the expression ‘pin drop silence’ is an Indianism. Native speakers of English don’t use it.”
“Really? What do they say?”
“They normally say, ‘hear a pin drop’. Everyone was so stunned by the announcement, you could have heard a pin drop.”
“In other words, there was absolute silence. The funeral home was so quiet that you could have heard a pin drop. It was pretty scary, actually.”
“Some use ‘fall’ instead of ‘drop’. When Tejah asked Divya to marry him, she didn’t say anything for a few seconds. The silence was deafening — one could have heard a pin fall.”
“The poor chap must have started sweating. According to this article, several washed-up politicians were present at the function. What does ‘washed up’ mean?”
“When you refer to someone as being ‘washed up’, what you’re suggesting is that the person is no longer as successful as he once was. He has no chance of...”
Washed up
“The person has no chance of becoming great again. Is that what you’re saying?”
“That’s right! For example, around this time last year, many sports writers were saying that both Federer and Nadal were washed up.”
“How wrong they were! That’s the problem being a sportsperson, I guess. You’re all washed up by the time you’re 30 or 40.”
“It happens to actors as well. Directors don’t cast women who are in their 30s in lead roles because they believe they’re washed up.”
“Our news channels provide opportunities to washed-up politicians to air their views.”
“The feedbacks that they give to the reporters...”
“Feedback and not feedbacks.”
“What?”
“The plural of ‘feedback’ is ‘feedback’ and not ‘feedbacks’. The feedback that we got from the students and the parents was positive.”
“Vinitha got immediate feedback on her dissertation from her supervisor.”
“Get feedback from your customers before you start trying to improve your product.”
“That’s what one of our rival companies did last year, and now they’re laughing all the way to the bank.”
“Laughing all the way to the bank? Why would they do that?”
“The expression is mostly limited to informal contexts. When you say that someone is laughing all the way to the bank, you mean that the person is making lots of money.”
“Is it because the person did something smart?”
“Not necessarily. It could be because of some other person’s stupidity. Nobody wanted to publish my father’s novel. Finally, my cousin decided to do it himself. Now, he’s laughing all the way to the bank.”
“How about this example? If we don’t have a tie-up with this company, someone else will. And they will be laughing all the way to the bank.”

“Wow! You have a lot of cutleries. When did you buy this knife?”
“A couple of years ago. By the way, it’s cutlery and not cutleries. Everything that you use — the knives, forks, spoons, etc. — is usually referred to as cutlery.”

“If he’s like my father, he probably doesn’t care about the players of today. Does he say there’s too much showboating in today’s game?”
“Showboating? What does it mean?”
“The annoying way some players behave on the field just to attract the attention of the spectators and the television cameras.”
“You mean showing off on the field?”
“I guess you could say that. The expression is mostly used in the context of sports to show disapproval. The thing I like about Federer and Nadal is that there’s no showboating after they win a big event.”
“But when an athlete performs something truly extraordinary, I suppose you could excuse his or her showboating.”
“Most definitely. Someone who indulges in a lot of showboating is called a ‘showboat’. For example, some of my cousin’s teammates think he’s nothing more than a showboat.”

“Tell me, is the word ‘all right’ spelt as one word or two? I’ve often seen it spelt ‘a..l..r..i..g..h..t’. Is it okay to spell it this way?”
“That’s the spelling that many people use — especially, in informal contexts. But in formal styles of writing, ‘a..l..l..r..i..g..h..t’ is still the preferred spelling. It’s safer to spell it as two words instead of one.”
“I must remember to tell Sujatha this. She, as usual, told me...”

“When you ‘give someone the needle’, you irritate or annoy the individual.”
“Really? I suppose you annoy the person by criticising him all the time.”
“That’s one way of giving the person the needle. You can also irritate him by teasing him. It’s also possible to say ‘needle someone’.”
“How about this example? I say silly things just to needle my parents.”
“Most people do that. Prassana’s friends gave him the needle when he came to college wearing an orange shirt and a purple tie.”
“Good grief! What a terrible combination. My grandmother is always needling me about my long hair and beard.”

“He’s started something that he can’t stop! And chances are, the series of actions are going to create a lot of problems for him.”
“Very good. Not just problems, the action may have disastrous consequences. According to this article, many street children are on the slippery slope towards a life of crime by the time they turn ten.”

Origins

        text: `“President Trump has been calling some people a ‘nutjob’. What does it mean?”
“The word has the same meaning as ‘nut case’. When you call someone...”
“I think I know what ‘nut case’ means. It means crazy, doesn’t it?”
“That’s right! When you call someone a ‘nutjob’ or a ‘nut case’, what you’re suggesting is that the person is mad or mentally imbalanced. It’s used in informal contexts to show disapproval. ‘Nutjob’ can be written as one word or two.”
“I see. A lot of people in my class avoid Roshni because they think she’s a nutjob.”
“It’s probably because she keeps to herself! I’ve talked to Roshni, and she’s definitely not a nutjob. Many people in my office think our new Manager is a real nutjob.”
“Gopi was telling me about him. He sounds like a real nutjob, all right. I believe he wants everyone in the company to work seven days a week. What a silly idea! Who would...”
“I wouldn’t rubbish the idea, if I were you. Our company, as you know, is...”
“Rubbish the idea? Does ‘rubbish’ in this context mean ‘criticise’?”
“That’s right. When you rubbish someone’s idea, you criticise it. You make it clear that the idea is trivial or worthless. It’s also possible to rubbish people.”
“I see. It wasn’t much of a debate. The two candidates merely rubbished each other.”
“That’s what most politicians do nowadays. Americans, by the way, say ‘trash’ instead of ‘rubbish’. The Minister trashed the idea that he had a Swiss bank account.”
“The media rubbished/trashed the team for its poor performance.”
“A few minutes ago, you said that I shouldn’t rubbish your new manager’s idea of working seven days a week. Why would you want to work seven...”
“The company is in trouble. We’re staring down the barrel of ...”
“Staring down the barrel? What are you talking about?”
“The expression ‘staring down the barrel’ is mostly used to suggest danger. It means that something bad is likely to happen.”
“But what is this barrel you are looking at?”
In trouble
“It’s the barrel of a gun.”
“Staring into a gun? That would mean that someone is pointing a gun at you. If that’s the case, you’re definitely in very serious trouble”
“That’s right! That’s why the expression is associated with danger. In fact, the original expression was ‘staring down the barrel of a gun’.”
“I guess this means that the expression can’t be used for anything positive.”
“No, it can’t. It’s always associated with negative things. If the market doesn’t pick up, our company will be staring down the barrel of bankruptcy.”
“Really? Can I say, we were looking down the barrel of defeat when we lost our sixth wicket with only 50 runs on the board?”
“Sounds good. Our client is planning to sue us. You know that most people get nervous when they stare down the barrel of a lawsuit.”
“I know! If your company is in urgent need for a loan, why don’t you...”
“It is not ‘need for a loan’, but ‘urgent need of a loan’. When you mean ‘require’ it is always ‘need of’. For example, your scooter is in need of a wash.”
“Your company is in desperate need of cash.”
