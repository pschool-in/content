          text: `“After shouting at me for five minutes, she tells me I know nothing about computers.”
“That’s how Sujatha is! You know that! Now, pull yourself together and get on with the job at hand.”
“Pull myself together? How do I do that?”
“When you tell someone to pull himself together, what you’re asking him to do is to calm down — to stop being angry or upset about something.”
“In other words, you want me to regain my composure. How about this example? Sujatha’s dad has always been tough on her. Whenever something didn’t go according to plan, he told her to pull herself together.”
“When Devashish lost the election by two votes, we thought he would be devastated. But he pulled himself together in no time.”
“That’s true. Although everyone expected the race to be neck to neck, I don’t think anyone expected Devashish to lose.”
“I don’t think he did either. By the way, it’s ‘neck and neck’ and not ‘neck to neck’.”
“The race is too close to call. The three candidates are running neck and neck.”
“My grandmother says as you get older, it becomes difficult to pull yourself together.”
“That’s understandable, I guess. As you get older, it becomes difficult to deal with the unexpected. Talking about the unexpected, I hear that you and your friends are throwing your boss a surprise party.”
Not a surprise
“Who told you about the party? Who let the cat out of the bag?”
“Cat? What cat? What are you talking about?”
“When you say, ‘don’t let the cat out of the bag’, what you mean is keep it a secret. In this case, don’t tell anyone about the party.”
“And if someone does let the cat out the bag, it means that they have revealed the secret.”
“That’s right! They may have revealed the secret to someone quite unintentionally — accidentally. Only two people in our office knew about the merger, and they did not let the cat out of the bag till the two companies had signed the relevant contracts.”
“Rupa wanted her engagement to Suresh to be a secret. But her best friend Shanthi let the cat out of the bag.”
“So, who let the cat out of the bag regarding the party? Was it Suman?”
“How does it matter? How is your boss’ new house? I saw the ad in the paper, and...”
“The complex is quite fancy, all right! Considering how much the builder was charging for each villa, I thought the construction work was pretty slipshod.”
“Slipshod? Does it mean a careless piece of work? Not well done?”
“That’s right! When you say that a piece of work is slipshod, what you’re suggesting is that it hasn’t been well thought out or executed. It’s crude and full of mistakes. The new manager was fired when he made a slipshod presentation at the board meeting.”
“The assignment we submitted was slipshod. We’ve been asked to redo it.”
“Praveen is a wonderful carpenter. But whatever you do, never hurry him. If you do, he gets angry and does a slipshod job.”
“In that case, I’ll stay out of his way.”

“Instead of making me guess, why don’t you save us both some time and just spit it out?”
“Spit it out? What are you talking about? There’s nothing in my mouth to spit out.”
“When you tell someone ‘to spit something out’, what you would like him or her to do is to say what’s on his or her mind.”
“I see. You want him to tell you what he’s thinking about. In other words, what’s going through his mind!”
“That’s right! It is an expression mostly used in informal contexts. Here’s an example. I know you’re dying to tell us Navin’s secret. Come on, spit it out.”
“No way! I promised him, I would tell no one. There’s no way I’m spitting it out!”
“In that case, spit out the interesting thing my neighbour told you.”
“It was about the speech that the Chief Minister gave last night. He said...”
“A speech given by a politician! Forget it!”
“Did you listen to our Chief Minister’s speech last night?”
“I was busy watching the match. Since when did you get interested in politics?”
To compliment or not
“I’m not! I was watching the match too. But my father switched channels at nine. Ended up listening to some of the speech. I was surprised to hear the Chief Minister pay the members of Opposition several compliments.”
“According to this morning newspaper reports, they were left-handed compliments.”
“Left-handed compliments? Are you saying they were not compliments?”
“When you say that something is a ‘left-handed compliment’, what you’re suggesting is that what sounds like a compliment isn’t one — it is, in fact, an insult.”
“In other words, it is a ‘backhanded’ compliment.”
“Exactly! Sujatha told me that I had a nice smile. But it turned out to be left-handed compliment. She went on to ask me who my dentist was.”
“Implying that that the secret behind your beautiful smile was your dentist. That sounds like Sujatha all right! Whenever she pays you a compliment, you can be pretty sure that it’s a left-handed one.”
“Some politicians are famous for their backhanded compliments. So, tell me, ...”
“No, you tell me. How do you pronounce ‘s..h..o..o’? Does it sound like ‘shoe’?”
“That’s right! ‘Shoo’ is the sound you make when you attempt to drive or scare an animal away. One can ‘shoo away’ an animal or one can ‘shoo away’ a person.”
“How about this example? Revathi shooed me away because the baby was sleeping.”
“That’s a good example. My grandfather spends most of his early mornings shooing the birds away.”
“The kids went to my grandmother to say they were sorry, but she shooed them away.”
“Good example. But I don’t think any grandmother would do that!
“But she did! She was so shocked by their...shocked at their behaviour...Which one is correct? Shocked at or shocked by their behaviour?
“The two can be used interchangeably in most contexts, actually. Indians, in general, prefer ‘shocked by’. The teachers and the parents were shocked by/at the Chief Guest’s comments. They wrote a strong letter of protest.”
“Most people were shocked by/at the children’s behaviour.”
“Now, please leave before I shoo you away.”

“Karthik and business? I don’t think he has the smarts to run a business.”
“The smarts? Are you saying that he’s not smart enough to run a business?”
“In informal contexts, the word ‘smarts’ is used to mean intelligence. Especially the kind of intelligence you require to handle a difficult situation.”
“The average Indian politician has the smarts to wriggle out of any tricky situation.”
“My uncle believes that if my boss had any smarts, he would make me a manager soon.”
“You are lucky to have such an uncle. Mine thinks I don’t have the smarts to graduate.”
“Ouch! This must be your uncle in Florida. How is he doing by the way?”
“He is doing okay. Hurricane Irma damaged his house quite badly.”
“What else do you expect from a war goddess. I’m sure she...”
“War goddess? What are you talking about?”
“Irma is actually the name of a war goddess. She’s always...”
“Like any war goddess, this hurricane destroyed quite a few things in its path. Could you please explain me how the word...”
“How many times do I have to tell you, it’s not ‘explain me’, but ‘explain to me’? Could you please explain to me how to solve this problem?”
“I explained to John why he shouldn’t spend money on a new cell phone.”
“Or you could also say, I explained why he shouldn’t spend money on a new cell phone.”
“The principal explained why the teachers were going on strike. Now, could you tell me how h..u..n..k..e..r is pronounced?”
“The first syllable rhymes with ‘skunk’, ‘bunk’ and ‘sunk’. Why do you ask?”
“When I was reading about the storm in Florida, most reports said that people had to hunker down. I was wondering...”
Taking refuge
“The word ‘hunker’ is mostly used in American English in informal contexts to mean to squat. When you ‘hunker down’, you sit on your heels with your knees bent.”
“Like a wicket keeper, you mean?”
“I guess you could say that. The expression has another meaning as well. When you ‘hunker down’, you settle down. You make yourself as comfortable as possible because you have a long wait ahead of you.”
“Since the situation you’re in is a difficult or a dangerous one, you’re taking refuge.”
“Exactly! A few weeks ago, the people in Miami hunkered down for a storm.”
“During the riots in the city, we hunkered down in our neighbour’s house.”
“That’s a good example. Reporters hunkered down in the park opposite the actor’s house.”
“My uncle and his family hunkered down in a school near their house. They’ve shifted to an apartment since... Tell me, does one ‘shift’ or ‘move’ to a new house?”
“We Indians generally use ‘shift’. But native speakers prefer ‘move’. I’m planning to move into a bigger apartment next year.”
“How about this example? My father thinks our colony has become very crowded. He wants to move house.”
“God bless your father!”
