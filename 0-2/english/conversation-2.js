Sarah: Oh, it's so adorable! But it looks lost. We should find its owner.
Emily: Yes, let's knock on our neighbors' doors and ask if it belongs to anyone.
[After knocking on a few doors]
Neighbor: That's my kitten! Thank you for finding her. She must have slipped out of the house.

Meera: Yes, I searched everywhere. Maybe it fell out of my bag at school.
[The next day at school]
Meera: Hi, Lily. Did you find a key yesterday? It's for my diary.
Lily: Yes, I did! I found it near the library. I thought it looked important.
Meera: Thank you so much, Lily. I was worried. Now my diary is safe again.`
